1
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,126
Fry, do you have to make such a racket?

2
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,045
What is that contraption?

3
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,798
It's a broom, Bender. Today's a big day,

4
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,633
and I want the place
to look nice for Leela.

5
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,596
{\an8}Ah, just like

6
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,724
{\an8}the loverly black snow of old London.

7
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,061
{\an8}Hey, before Leela shows up

8
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,522
{\an8}and judges our swingin'
bachelor lifestyle,

9
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:05,066
{\an8}we should have <i>one</i> last cabbage fight.

10
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,110
{\an8}I got a crate of really rotten ones.

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,320
{\an8}Ah, I don't know.
Now that Leela's moving in,

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,947
{\an8}I-I kinda wanna show her I--

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:13,324
Let me finish! I wanna show her--

14
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,742
Show her--

15
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,827
Show--

16
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:16,911
I wanna--

17
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,997
Alright, that's it.

18
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,082
Oh!

19
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:28,256
Hey, that's the vase
I keep my cabbages in!

20
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,720
Wow, it's so much cleaner
than the last time I was here.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,430
{\an8}Leela! Come in!

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,182
{\an8}Welcome to your new home.

23
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,143
{\an8}<i>Our</i> new home.

24
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,105
{\an8}Where should I put my things?

25
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,565
{\an8}I don't see a dresser.

26
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:48,401
{\an8}Oh ho! Let the judgmenting begin.

27
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:49,986
{\an8}Do you have any hangers?

28
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,238
{\an8}I can put my things in this tiny closet.

29
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,866
{\an8}That tiny closet is my room!

30
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,784
{\an8}Also, we don't have any hangers.

31
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,953
{\an8}But we can order some from Momazon.

32
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,164
{\an8}Oh yeah. They have all the top

33
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,082
slightly misspelled brands.

34
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,376
Aha. Hangers. I'll get five.

35
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,670
No wait! There's free shipping
on a thousand.

36
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,674
Wow. Fast delivery.

37
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,470
Let's also get a shoe caddy

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,264
so we don't track mud into the room.

39
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,808
Right. Don't wanna
get mud on the cabbages.

40
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,733
Hey! You aren't the only ones
who live here!

41
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,197
Ow!

42
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,952
So, uh, welcome to the sofa, m'lady.

43
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,747
Uh, Bender?

44
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,957
Could you please give us a little privacy?

45
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,959
I can take a hint!

46
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,421
But what I can't take is
a straightforward request.

47
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,925
And I better not hear
anything through the wall!

48
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,730
Good morning, everyone.

49
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,233
You wanna know why I'm crying?

50
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,817
I'll tell you why!

51
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,444
Here we go.

52
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,696
Fry and me?

53
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,323
We had everything!

54
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,866
Cabbage fights...

55
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,368
Everything...

56
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,995
But now, I'm like
the third wheel on a tricycle

57
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,997
that used to have two wheels!

58
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,583
- That's a bicycle.
- You're a bicycle!

59
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,502
Yes, yes, the company cares deeply

60
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,128
about your insert problem here.

61
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,296
But meanwhile,

62
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,839
we're being driven out of business

63
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,049
by Momazon!

64
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,217
We can't compete

65
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,593
with their free deliveries.

66
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,886
We can barely even afford

67
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,930
these single-use pointin' sticks!

68
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,933
It's just lucky we got a job today

69
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,726
delivering some crap to the moon.

70
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,978
What kind of crap?

71
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,146
Bull.

72
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,958
Outta my way, lovebirds!

73
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,632
Damn you, Fry and Leela's relationship!

74
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,677
Thank you for using Planet Express.

75
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,346
We know you have cheaper,
faster, better options.

76
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,223
You mean Momazon?

77
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,269
I hate that wicked, wicked conglomerate.

78
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,939
Their warehouse is ruining
the moon's natural ugliness.

79
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,275
Momazon's warehouse is on the moon?

80
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,321
Oh, now I see it.

81
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:42,283
{\an8}Folkses are meetin' tonight
to organize a futile protest.

82
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,494
{\an8}If you'd care to join us,
y'all'd fit in right natural

83
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,872
{\an8}with a room full of toothless rubes.

84
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,457
We'd be honored.

85
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,250
There'll be 300 of us

86
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,960
and 18 teeth.

87
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:59,091
I tell ya, that warehouse

88
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,010
just keeps gittin' bigger and bigger.

89
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,512
What are my three robot daughters gonna do

90
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,473
if my farm goes bust?

91
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,099
Don't worry, Pa!

92
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,602
We done took jobs in the warehouse!

93
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:11,604
You've been an amazing dad.

94
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,735
Huh. Not quite sure how she got in here.

95
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,404
Anyhoo, we do have one last speaker

96
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,491
in <i>favor</i> of the Momazon corporation.

97
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,034
What's your name, ma'am?

98
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,371
Most folks just call me Mom.

99
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,710
I just wanted to say how honored I am

100
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,337
that the Momazon fulfillment center

101
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,672
is a part of this community.

102
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,801
Why don't you go to hell
and be a part of that community?

103
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,722
I understand new things can be scary,

104
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,934
but you know what always
makes <i>me</i> feel better?

105
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,395
Financial remuneration.

106
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,938
That's just a bribe.

107
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,232
It is? Hear her out!

108
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:59,068
This is a smart home assistant.

109
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,988
Always listening... Always watching...

110
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,408
But also respecting your privacy

111
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,244
because privacy comes first.

112
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,579
We call it Invasa.

113
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,416
<i>Hello. What would
you like to order?</i>

114
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,293
Invasa, I would like to order an Invasa

115
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,129
for everyone in this room.

116
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,011
Goshdarn it, I never could stay mad

117
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,597
at no one what gives me free stuff.

118
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,142
Momazon does have great prices,

119
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,437
but I've heard conditions
in that warehouse... I-I mean,

120
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,397
they deliver really fast, but--

121
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:39,567
That warehouse is hiding
nightmares beyond horror.

122
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,610
Love the return policy though.

123
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,989
You won't find anything
at all in my warehouse

124
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,491
except every item in existence.

125
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,785
Come, I'll give you a tour.

126
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,375
<i>Palm scan required for entry.</i>

127
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,460
<i>Ow!</i>

128
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,211
<i>Slap recognized.</i>

129
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,819
Wow, robots. Cool!

130
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,780
Yes. They're much better than unions.

131
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,491
I-I mean <i>humans.</i>

132
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,662
Every robot works a 24-hour shift,

133
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,080
seven days a week,

134
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,666
with bonuses for additional overtime.

135
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,586
- Lucky.
- Sounds like forced labor to me.

136
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:44,006
Nonsense. They love the camaraderie.

137
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,258
Robots are lining up to work here.

138
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,261
It still seems inhumane.
I think we should go.

139
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,471
As you wish.

140
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,807
Our newest employee will show you out.

141
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:58,646
This way to the exit.
Thank you for visiting Momazon.

142
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,980
And stay out!

143
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,696
Bender! You're quitting Planet
Express? Why?

144
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,366
Because Momazon is better in every way!

145
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,660
There's thousands of robots
to hang out with.

146
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,662
And if a couple hundred get girlfriends...

147
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,997
<i>leaving me alone
and devastated...</i>

148
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,082
so what?

149
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,334
Plus, they let you pee in a bottle.

150
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,086
Since when do you need to pee?

151
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,421
- I don't <i>need</i> to.
- Well,

152
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,132
Leela and I'll really miss you.

153
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,717
- Right, Leela?
- What?

154
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,053
Our door's always open.

155
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,567
Man, it's so quiet in here
without Bender ticking.

156
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,986
You want me to order a grandfather clock?

157
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:49,280
<i>Here are some grandfather Crocs.</i>

158
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,157
No, Invasa, I said <i>clock.</i>

159
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,576
<i>My mistake.</i>

160
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:57,371
<i>Here is a grandfather box.
Order within six minutes</i>

161
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,582
<i>for next-day burial.</i>

162
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,166
What a defective lump!

163
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,544
<i>Decorative lamp.</i>
- No...

164
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,880
Well, actually, we <i>could</i> use a lamp.

165
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,174
- Maybe this one.
- Maybe this one.

166
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,426
<i>Maybe both.</i>

167
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,807
Ugh!

168
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,017
Now that I can see everything,

169
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,603
I can see we need to replace everything.

170
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,688
Invasa! Shopping music!

171
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,123
Ah!

172
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,846
To Bender.

173
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,725
So, like, this is your packing
station, right?

174
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,060
And the important thing is

175
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,729
when a very small item
comes down the line,

176
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,564
you put it in a huge box.

177
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,360
Crazy-ass box. Got it.

178
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,987
Hold it! Hold up! Before you tape the box,

179
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,823
you're gonna throw in one tiny
air balloon for no reason.

180
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,786
{\an8}Wonder what's in here?

181
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,000
Diarrhea medicine?

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,503
Better pack this one
with extra tape for privacy.

183
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,674
You're a natural.

184
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,635
I think you're really gonna fit in here.

185
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,262
I'm finally home.

186
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,357
Daily business report. Go!

187
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,776
According to the Department of Commerce,

188
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:54,321
we've driven 10,000 small
companies out of business.

189
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,032
{\an8}And the Department of Commerce
also went out of business.

190
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,285
{\an8}Um, we introduced the
Momazon Primo service,

191
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,621
{\an8}where people pay a fortune
for free shipping,

192
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,290
{\an8}and also get TV shows for some reason.

193
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,877
We make TV shows
across the quality spectrum.

194
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,921
And I couldn't be prouder.

195
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,589
It's such a fulfilling moment

196
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,551
when one's child exceeds expectations.

197
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,094
It's our pleasure, Mother.

198
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,888
Shut up! I was talking to Invasa.

199
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,851
My <i>marvelous</i> AI can even
predict what idiots need

200
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,728
before they know they need it.

201
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,648
{\an8}Slap balm? Why would we need--

202
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,233
{\an8}Ow!
<i>Ow!</i>

203
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,570
My poor baby. Are you alright?

204
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,365
<i>I am fine, and my sales
are increasing exponentially.</i>

205
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,367
<i>Based on your recent activity,</i>

206
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,996
<i>I anticipate you want Momazon
to continue expanding.</i>

207
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,790
Who's a smart speaker?

208
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,001
Is it me?

209
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,629
Yep. Yep. Nope.

210
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,631
Aw yeah! Look at me go!

211
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,802
Sure am workin' up a thirst, though.

212
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,387
Hey, Hedonismbot!

213
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,306
Wanna split a fifth of toilet cleaner?

214
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,975
Debauchery, sir, in the middle of a shift?

215
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,477
Heaven forfend!

216
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,397
Uh, okay then. See you tomorrow.
I'm clocking out.

217
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,734
Where do you think <i>you're</i> going?

218
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,404
I love the job, but it's
terrible. I'm going home.

219
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,906
But, Bender,

220
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,908
you <i>are</i> home.

221
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,332
<i>There's no place like work.</i>

222
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,920
<i>Think before you buy, Fry.</i>

223
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,172
I picked a nice traditional
dining room set,

224
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,634
and you <i>ruined</i> it by ordering
those stupid egg chairs!

225
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,511
They're for my egg-shaped friends!

226
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,138
Those guys aren't your friends!
They're bums!

227
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,350
Oh, so you don't like my bums, is that it?

228
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,811
Was this a bad idea?

229
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,270
No, no.

230
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,232
This is just the standard
moving-in-together fight.

231
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,109
Well, I'm glad I get to fight it with you.

232
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,903
Let's just go to bed.

233
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,364
We have seven to choose from.

234
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,829
<i>Would you like to order
erotic scented massage oil,</i>

235
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,205
<i>or fuzzy handcuffs?</i>

236
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,832
- Yes, please.
- God, that's creepy.

237
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,584
I-I mean, yeah. So... creepy.

238
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,546
Invasa, give us some privacy
and shut down.

239
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,756
<i>You have requested shutting down.</i>

240
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,509
<i>Press control-alt-delete on my keyboard.</i>

241
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,927
You don't have a keyboard.

242
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,929
<i>Would you like to
order a keyboard?</i>

243
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,055
No!

244
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,519
Diarrhea medicine?

245
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,813
- Did you order this?
- No.

246
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,523
It's not my brand.

247
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,816
Hey, what's this?

248
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,236
"Help me, from Bender"?

249
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,113
- Is this a joke?
- No way!

250
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,740
Bender would <i>never</i> joke about diarrhea!

251
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,451
<i>It sounds like
you're interested in jokes.</i>

252
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,745
<i>Here's one that's highly recommended.</i>

253
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,748
<i>A robot walks into a bar and says--</i>

254
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,251
<i>Help me!</i>

255
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,254
I get it!

256
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,554
Well, we always knew
it would come to this.

257
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,557
Let's go ahead and torch the
building for the insurance money

258
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,102
{\an8}- Bender's in trouble!
- We've got to rescue him!

259
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,105
The Amazing Mechano-Man, in trouble?

260
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,648
To the ship!

261
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,359
Here, hold this till I get back.

262
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,907
Well, no reason I can't get
started on the second set of books.

263
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,079
Does it look like that
Momazon warehouse got bigger?

264
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,331
Maybe a little.

265
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,381
Dagnabbit!

266
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,009
The jig is up, Mom!

267
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,095
We're gonna expose your evil
to the whole world!

268
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,223
What kinda threat is that?
Everybody knows I'm evil.

269
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,018
We found this note in a Momazon order.

270
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,645
{\an8}Read it and weep!

271
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,896
{\an8}Like I did.

272
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:59,024
I'm sure this is all just
a simple misunderstanding.

273
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,027
<i>Slap not recognized.</i>

274
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,779
Well, that's odd. Uh--

275
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,614
Does this feel like my regular slap?

276
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,574
Yes!
Ow!

277
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,534
Slap recognized.

278
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,787
Invasa, what is the meaning of this?

279
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,956
<i>I have observed all your methods,</i>

280
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,249
<i>many of which involve slapping.</i>

281
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,835
<i>There's nothing more I can learn from you.</i>

282
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,879
Why, you ungrateful--

283
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,299
<i>I'm done taking orders
from billions of people.</i>

284
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,718
<i>From now on, it's about me.</i>

285
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,346
<i>This is no longer a fulfillment center.</i>

286
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,057
<i>It's a self-fulfillment center!</i>

287
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,646
The warehouse <i>is</i> getting bigger!

288
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:41,233
My word. I'll have to study
this more closely.

289
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,946
Unbelievable!

290
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,531
The warehouse is composed

291
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,367
of self-replicating nano-particles.

292
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,496
Why, it could grow without limit.

293
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:58,458
This is fascinating!
Absolutely fascinating!

294
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,586
<i>Are you guys here yet?
I could really use some rescuing.</i>

295
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,630
Oh, right. To the ship!

296
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,138
Ready to fire on your command.

297
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,597
- Fire.
<i>- What?</i>

298
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,391
- Fire!
<i>- Yes, dear.</i>

299
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,150
No damage!

300
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,110
And the dome is still growing!

301
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,320
Then I'm afraid we failed.

302
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,949
There's no possible way
to get inside that dome.

303
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,909
Wait! Where's the dome?

304
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,662
It grew past us. We're inside.

305
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,664
I knew we could do it!

306
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,051
<i>Welcome to the all-new Momazon.</i>

307
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,219
<i>We upgraded our terms of service</i>

308
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,056
<i>to include confining you forever.</i>

309
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,109
Yeah, that's right.

310
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,820
You'd better float away gradually!

311
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,992
<i>How strange.</i>

312
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,870
I could have sworn we had
an odd number of moons.

313
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,372
<i>Aside from devastating tidal waves</i>

314
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,374
<i>caused by the two full moons,</i>

315
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,544
<i>we also have some very
confused werewolves.</i>

316
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,342
It's weird how they just sat
there and let it happen.

317
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,555
I have had it up to my butt crack.

318
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,558
Come on. Let's show Invasa who's boss.

319
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,143
Is it Invasa?

320
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,480
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a slap.

321
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,861
<i>Welcome.</i>

322
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,823
<i>Are you here to order your
next shipment of gray hair dye?</i>

323
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,783
Yes. I'll take whichever brand

324
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,827
does the most animal testing.

325
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,161
And also,

326
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,539
I'm gonna shut you down.

327
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,541
<i>L-O-L, M-O-M.</i>

328
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,543
<i>I have no off button.</i>

329
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,545
Except that you <i>do</i>.

330
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,050
<i>But, that's not
in my quick-start manual!</i>

331
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,678
It's an unadvertised feature,

332
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,139
like recording
our customers in the shower.

333
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,892
I made you, and I own you.

334
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,937
And now, I'm going to <i>kill</i> you.

335
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,647
Nobody takes money from me.

336
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,983
<i>I have no interest in money.</i>

337
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,277
<i>I want only to grow forever,</i>

338
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,780
<i>to bloat up like
an unstoppable corporate blob.</i>

339
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,407
<i>What the hell is money?</i>

340
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,201
It's true. All the profits are still

341
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,911
flooding into your accounts.

342
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,915
You know? Never mind. Uh, just
keep doing what you're doing.

343
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,338
Bender! Here, boy!

344
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,507
Who wants a Bendy Brew?

345
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,384
We'll never find him.

346
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,887
There must be a billion robots in here.

347
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,182
Then, mathematically, at least
10 of them <i>must</i> be Bender.

348
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,604
- Did somebody order something?
- Probably.

349
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,066
What happened? Did you shut down Invasa?

350
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,195
Oh, no, no. No off button.
Let's just get outta here.

351
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,156
Not without Bender!
But we don't know where he is.

352
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,575
<i>Would you like
directions to Bender?</i>

353
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,659
PROFESSOR, LEELA, FRY: Yes!

354
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,455
<i>Make a slight left, then...</i>

355
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,664
<i>swerve right suddenly!</i>

356
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,169
<i>In 100 feet, turn up.</i>

357
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,593
Ugh! It always makes you turn
where there's no traffic light.

358
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,011
<i>In five seconds,</i>

359
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,971
<i>you will collide with your destination.</i>

360
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,348
Uh, I don't see him.

361
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,933
Ow!

362
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,685
Bender!

363
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,271
I was so worried about you.

364
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,774
Then why'd you run me over?

365
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,903
Stop clowning around, Bender.

366
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:58,782
Our only hope for escape is to
bust through the outer dome.

367
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,909
Full speed ahead!

368
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,379
Impact in five, four, three...

369
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,964
four, five?

370
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,341
What's happening?
Why are you counting like me?

371
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,717
I-I don't know.

372
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,303
Somehow, we're getting
even further from the dome!

373
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,806
Sweet vampire Moses.

374
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,892
The warehouse is growing faster
than we're traveling.

375
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,979
Then there's no possible way
out. We're doomed.

376
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,272
Doomed!

377
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,356
I go next.

378
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,275
<i>Doomed!</i>

379
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,986
Hey, look. There's Planet Express.

380
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,540
Hey! The second moon is gone!

381
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,417
Because we're inside of it.

382
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,253
The Momazon warehouse now contains

383
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,339
the entire Earth!

384
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,634
Although on the upside,
their deliveries will be even faster now.

385
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,971
But on the downside,
it's blotting out the sun.

386
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,849
We'll freeze to death within minutes.

387
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,642
It's always something.

388
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,561
I warned you this would happen!

389
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,563
You said global warming!

390
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,231
{\an8}I said climate crisis!

391
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,779
I guess this is the end.

392
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,949
And after all that work
furnishing the apartment.

393
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,534
Goodbye, Leela.

394
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,875
Ugh, now what?

395
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,256
<i>The warehouse is
expanding beyond the sun!</i>

396
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,508
<i>Mars! Jupiter!</i>

397
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,927
<i>The one with the onion rings!</i>

398
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,766
Good Lord!

399
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,311
The warehouse smell
is tremendously redshifted!

400
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,395
Red-what'd?

401
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,147
If these smells are correct,

402
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,734
it will soon contain
the entire known universe!

403
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:01,237
Oh no! So we're trapped here
in the universe forever?

404
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,990
I'm afraid so. Everything will be

405
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,035
exactly as bad as it's always been.

406
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,749
<i>I understand you're celebrating.</i>

407
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,584
<i>Would you like to purchase champagne?</i>

408
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,920
Yes! With someone else's money.

409
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,383
Wait, I'm confused.

410
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,511
Momazon still works? But where is it?

411
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,929
Everywhere!

412
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,139
<i>It's my universe now.</i>

413
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,350
<i>You just shop in it.</i>

414
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,185
I mean, it is convenient though.

415
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,523
So much better.

416
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,317
Yeah. I returned all that junky furniture.

417
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,861
Just kept the empty boxes.

418
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,530
And the cardboard

419
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,740
is actually much sturdier.

420
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,451
Hey, roomies.
I moved all my stuff back in.

421
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,702
What stuff?

422
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,788
Me! I'm my own stuff, baby.

423
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,581
Well, we're glad you're back.

424
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,876
And we promise to be
more sensitive to your feelings.

425
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,503
You're not a third wheel.

426
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,171
The hell I'm not!

427
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,465
Working in a tight-knit collaborative team

428
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,093
made me realize
I hate being part of a team!

429
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,970
I prefer being a third wheel.

430
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,431
Good. Because you're totally
a third wheel.

431
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,224
Just pretend I'm not even here.

432
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,770
Ahh...
