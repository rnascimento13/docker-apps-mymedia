00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:18,045
It will if we go back
in time and stop him!

180
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,398
[gasps]Oh!

181
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:28,055
Professor, no! You can'’t tongue
the father of our country!

182
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,579
[whoosh]

183
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:32,625
Where are we?

184
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,715
Also, when are we?

185
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:38,108
68th and Broadway,
Colonial Era.

186
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,284
[cow bell jingles,
cow lowing]

187
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,591
Rush hour.

188
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,163
By my calculations,

189
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,687
this head trip will last
at most 24 hours.

190
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:54,648
We need to stop that monster
David Farnsworth!

191
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,300
LEELA:
Look at the date
on this newspaper.

192
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,216
April 17, 1775.

193
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:02,177
Say, on this exact date,

194
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:05,658
the Continental Congress was
meeting secretly in New York.

195
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,312
Maybe they can help us.

196
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,879
But they could be
meeting anywhere.

197
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,620
What are we going to do,
search building to building?

198
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,884
PROFESSOR:
We'’ll start with that one.

199
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:18,192
Alexander Hamilton of New York,
how say you?

200
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,237
Nay!

201
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:20,586
John Hancock

202
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:22,197
and John Adams of Massachusetts?

203
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,502
Yea!Yea!

204
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,504
The yeas have it.

205
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:28,202
Our nation'’s official joke state
shall be New Jersey.

206
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,596
[knocking]

207
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:31,206
Uh-oh.

208
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,337
[munching, swallowing]

209
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,818
[guns cocking,
door squeaks open]

210
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:38,125
Ah, '’tis just our
new crock pot.

211
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:39,605
Watch it, wiggy.

212
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,172
I ain'’t no
stinking crock.

213
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,523
We'’ll see about that
in five hours.

214
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,570
Halt! From whence comest
thou, one-eyed maiden?

215
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:50,051
Uh... ever been to Peru?

216
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,355
Certainly not.

217
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:52,532
I'’m from Peru.

218
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,446
Clam up, founding fathers.

219
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,537
We need help
locating the treacherous forger

220
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,015
who forged this forgery.

221
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,451
[gasping]

222
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,105
My word.

223
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,499
If these enter circulation,

224
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,847
our economy will
be destroyed,

225
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:07,284
and with it, our
chance at independence.

226
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:08,851
Only one man
in the colonies

227
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,375
has a printing press
fine enough to make these.

228
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,769
Our good friend
Ben Franklin!

229
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:16,424
Uh-oh. Isn'’t Franklin
in Philadelphia?

230
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:19,514
When he'’s not in Charlotte
or Marybelle or Louisa.

231
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,562
[laughter]

232
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,738
I don'’t get it.

233
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,783
I'’m sure
no one'’s ever said this before,

234
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,570
but I must get to Philadelphia
as quickly as possible!

235
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,837
Oh! Why couldn'’t my
disgraced ancestor

236
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:40,187
have lived in
the NASCAR era?

237
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,889
[door squeaks open]

238
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:49,763
Dr. Franklin, your new
steam engine is here.

239
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,591
I ain'’t no stinking
steam engine!

240
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,679
[ding]Chicken'’s ready.

241
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,332
You may go,
Louisa.

242
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,552
Now I get it.

243
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,340
[vibrating]

244
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,821
Fascinating.
Be you man or machine?

245
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,780
Mostly machine. Might be
a couple of dead cats in there.

246
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,434
Dr. Franklin, with
all due respect

247
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,394
to the brilliant
inventor of the... stove,

248
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,918
I must speak with you.Hmm?

249
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:19,619
I'’m looking for the scoundrel
who made this.

250
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:22,273
Intricate filigree,
satanic symbols.

251
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,840
Looks like one of mine.

252
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:27,626
[gasps]
But no, this is a fake!

253
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:31,369
Duh. It says "Colony
of Maffachufetts."

254
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:33,894
[scoffs]
More like Taxachufetts.

255
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,115
[sighs]
That'’s just how we print "S"s,
you ftupid fhitheads.

256
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,378
Someone must have
used my press

257
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,466
while I was poking
around in Charlotte.

258
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:44,730
Let'’s ask my apprentice,
David Farnsworth.

259
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,341
[gasps]
Farnsworth?!

260
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,559
That'’s him!
Arm yourselves!

261
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,652
I call it
the Franklinator.

262
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,130
[door squeaks open, gasps]

263
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,786
[squeaking]

264
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,701
The apprentice'’s suite is empty!
He'’s gone!

265
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:02,139
Wait. What'’s that glistening
in the chamber pot?

266
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:03,313
Let'’s find out!

267
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:07,578
Bender, do you know
what a chamber pot is?

268
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,451
I don'’t know,
and I don'’t care.

269
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,195
A Massachusetts
halfpenny?

270
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,543
Probably fake, too.

271
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,416
There'’s one way to find out.

272
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,722
[all groaning in disgust]What?

273
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,465
Bender bit a poo penny.
Bender bit a poo penny.

274
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,033
Look, '’tis but worthless tin.

275
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,254
Where could Farnsworth have
minted such a high quality fake?

276
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,299
Not here. But, you know,

277
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,475
I have a friend in Boston
who'’s an expert silversmith.

278
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,477
They could be connected.

279
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:39,220
There'’s only like 40 people
who do anything around here.

280
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,744
But Boston'’s 300 miles away,

281
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,268
and Bender kicked
our horse to death.

282
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,356
We'’ll never
get there in time.

283
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:49,533
Unless you have another
invention up your sleeve.

284
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,014
[scoffs]

285
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,363
Hmm...

286
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,495
[thunder crashes, rain falling]

287
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,500
How is this going
to get us to Boston?

288
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,241
Ow!

289
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,025
[grumbling]

290
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,245
Stupid Franklin.

291
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,375
I will get you!

292
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,160
[grumbling]

293
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,607
Ah, that scrap metal
I ordered is here.

294
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,393
I'’m 40% scrap metal.[metallic clang]

295
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,048
Well, Ben Franklin, my
fellow son of liber...

296
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,138
teakettles.

297
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,836
Yes, I'’ve made some
new teakettles.

298
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,967
Perfect for
special occasions.

299
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:35,450
Like hanging King
George in effigy...

300
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:39,235
and "H" and "I" are monograms
you can put on those kettles.

301
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,803
What are you looking at,
you British bastards?

302
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,197
Paul, we talked
about this.

303
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,899
Mr. Revere, we'’re looking
for a counterfeiter

304
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:52,683
who minted these
smelly halfpennies.

305
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,470
His name is
David Farnsworth.

306
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,341
Farnsworth? I just hired him

307
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,778
for the fall candlestick rush.

308
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,301
He'’s in the foundry
this very moment.

309
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,346
[all gasp]

310
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,217
Everybody, take a Franklinator.

311
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,397
Aw, I got a chipmunk.

312
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,101
Hee-yah!

313
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:20,451
Uh, wha...?

314
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:22,671
David Farnsworth,
I presume?

315
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,673
[in cockney accent]:
I is Davy Farnsworth.

316
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,806
Foof. You'’re a disgrace
to the very name

317
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,328
[imitating David]
"Farnsworth."

318
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,245
Look out. He'’s got
a bezelling planisher.

319
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,419
That'’s right.

320
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,161
Who wants to be bezelled?

321
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,466
[both grunting]

322
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,471
[grunting]

323
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,650
You idiot.
I'’m not a cannon.

324
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:54,049
Huh. I guess I
am a cannon.

325
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,485
[groans]

326
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:56,966
Time to prune
the family tree.

327
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:57,923
Wha!

328
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,274
[all cheering]

329
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:02,884
Huzzah!

330
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,452
I'’ve saved the Farnsworth name.

331
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,975
[panting]

332
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,847
Urgent message
for Mr. Revere.

333
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:11,110
"Mr. Revere,

334
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,460
"pray do not
'’fhit'’ your pants.

"The British attack
has begun.

00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,463
Cross the river and
watch for my signal."

337
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,769
I must ride.

338
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,207
[horse whinnies]

339
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,600
He has so much stuff.

340
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,471
He won'’t miss this.

341
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,389
Let'’s burn these counterfeits

342
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,522
and paddle the next swan boat
the hell out of Boston.

343
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,480
Here you go.Thanks.

344
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:39,139
Say, where did you
get that lantern?

345
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,446
From that old church
to the north.

346
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,971
They had two burning, so I
figured they wouldn'’t miss one.

347
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,322
"One if by land,
two if by sea."

348
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,980
The British are coming.
The British are coming.

349
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,546
By land. By land.

350
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,114
Gotta treat this OCD.
Gotta treat this OCD.

351
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,081
Fry, you dope.

352
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,038
You'’ve really screwed
