1
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,241
An American, Colonel.

2
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,535
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

3
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,034
Take him upstairs.

4
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,289
A moment. Please!

5
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,583
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

6
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,752
Colonel. I found it!

7
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,214
Do as he says. Open it.

8
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,605
The Lance of Longinus.

9
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,442
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

10
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,569
The Holy Lance.

11
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,040
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

12
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,083
Colonel, we need to talk.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,417
No time, Doctor.

14
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,044
The train to Berlin is waiting.

15
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,505
Search the woods!

16
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,548
Take the dogs.

17
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,925
Do you think that spy was alone?

18
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,052
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

19
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,262
On the double!

20
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,000
This man was with the American.

21
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,836
This is the American's bag.

22
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,672
What have I done?

23
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,595
Bring him to my carriage.

24
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,272
Careful.
This is the Führer's special relic!

25
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,136
Stay seated.

26
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,347
So...

27
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,143
you are a birdwatcher?

28
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,690
Yes. Because of the bombing,

29
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,610
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

30
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,282
We caught your accomplice.

31
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,993
The American.

32
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,690
There is a problem.

33
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,025
I must speak to the Colonel.

34
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,319
It's urgent.

35
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,588
I must speak with the Colonel.

36
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,924
It's about the Lance.

37
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,055
I only had a moment to look at it.

38
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,974
Of course, my training is in physics,

39
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,434
For God's sake, spit it out!

40
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,354
The Lance...

41
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,151
It's a fake.

42
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,653
A fake?

43
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,448
The blade is an alloy.

44
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,950
Fifty years old,

45
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,286
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

46
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,412
We're dead.

47
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,053
There is another relic on this train.

48
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,639
One with real power.

49
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,224
What are you talking about?

50
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,186
The Antikythera.

51
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:08,729
The Antikythera?!

52
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,814
Enough about that old dial!

53
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,233
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

54
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,027
and his mind!

55
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,572
Let me explain.

56
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,035
The Antikythera's power
is not supernatural.

57
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,370
It is mathematics.

58
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,582
Whoever harnesses it...

59
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,169
will not be King...

60
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,921
nor Emperor...

61
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,507
or Führer.

62
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,803
He will be God.

63
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,330
And how do you propose we tell him this?

64
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:09,831
My Führer,

65
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,417
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

66
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,836
But here is...

67
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,006
half of something you've never heard of.

68
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,509
Tell me,

69
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,469
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

70
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,139
A saboteur aboard.

71
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,641
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

72
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,225
That way!

73
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,189
What are you doing here?!

74
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,077
Who are you?

75
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,874
They have the Antikythera!

76
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,209
Drop the gun.

77
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,505
Give me the Antikythera.

78
02:03:14,853 --> 02:03:16,188
Time to destination?

79
02:03:17,397 --> 02:03:18,941
60 seconds.

80
02:04:07,364 --> 02:04:08,949
30 seconds.

81
02:04:20,294 --> 02:04:21,211
20 seconds.

82
02:04:27,092 --> 02:04:28,385
15 seconds.

83
02:04:33,557 --> 02:04:34,391
10 seconds.

84
02:04:35,309 --> 02:04:36,143
9!

85
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:37,895
8!

86
02:04:38,187 --> 02:04:39,021
7!

87
02:04:39,688 --> 02:04:40,522
6!

88
02:04:40,606 --> 02:04:41,857
Turn around!

89
02:04:42,566 --> 02:04:43,442
Abort!

90
02:04:43,942 --> 02:04:44,860
Turn around!

91
02:04:45,652 --> 02:04:46,528
ABORT!!!

92
02:04:46,778 --> 02:04:48,739
We're being pulled in!

93
02:04:58,749 --> 02:05:00,083
What are you doing?!

94
02:05:00,292 --> 02:05:01,126
This is my plane!

95
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,794
You're flying my plane!

96
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:28,779
We're going to DIE!!!

97
02:05:30,113 --> 02:05:31,823
We need to pull up!

98
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:54,847
Restart engines!

99
02:06:31,008 --> 02:06:32,718
Setting coordinates for Munich.

100
02:07:58,387 --> 02:07:59,263
Master...

101
02:07:59,346 --> 02:08:01,765
The Romans are getting closer.

102
02:08:03,517 --> 02:08:04,393
They have dragons!

103
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:49,980
Master...

104
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,651
Don't ride out there, Master!

105
02:08:55,235 --> 02:08:56,445
The dragons!!

106
02:09:06,705 --> 02:09:10,209
We must take down their dragons!

107
02:09:18,383 --> 02:09:19,218
Change course!

108
02:09:19,468 --> 02:09:20,844
The portal closes in minutes!

109
02:09:21,261 --> 02:09:22,179
I have to go back!

110
02:09:22,638 --> 02:09:23,764
I can't be here!

111
02:09:23,972 --> 02:09:25,057
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

112
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:26,683
The plane won't make it!!

113
02:11:40,776 --> 02:11:42,236
We're losing altitude!

114
02:11:43,487 --> 02:11:44,404
We're going down!

115
02:11:46,323 --> 02:11:47,908
I've lost control!

116
02:13:15,454 --> 02:13:16,830
Eureka.

117
02:15:26,543 --> 02:15:27,461
Master!

118
02:15:30,172 --> 02:15:31,965
We have to leave, Master.

119
02:15:49,024 --> 02:15:51,777
Two thousand years.

120
02:15:52,402 --> 02:15:53,570
We've come...

121
02:15:54,154 --> 02:15:57,157
two thousand years.

122
02:15:59,493 --> 02:16:02,621
But we didn't expect to meet...

123
02:16:03,163 --> 02:16:05,666
the great...

124
02:16:06,208 --> 02:16:08,252
Archimedes.

125
02:16:13,924 --> 02:16:14,842
You...

126
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:17,386
were always...

127
02:16:18,053 --> 02:16:19,304
going to...

128
02:16:19,888 --> 02:16:21,473
meet me.

129
02:16:31,066 --> 02:16:32,692
Apologies, Archimedes.

130
02:16:32,901 --> 02:16:34,236
I'm a fan...

131
02:16:34,486 --> 02:16:36,487
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

132
02:16:46,957 --> 02:16:47,790
I want...

133
02:16:47,875 --> 02:16:48,959
to stay...

134
02:16:49,334 --> 02:16:51,085
with you.

135
02:16:53,797 --> 02:16:56,049
You are a brilliant man...

136
02:16:56,299 --> 02:16:58,302
a wise man...

137
02:16:58,843 --> 02:17:00,179
a genius...

138
02:17:01,346 --> 02:17:03,682
a hero to your people.

139
02:17:04,391 --> 02:17:07,936
But he can't help you.

140
02:17:09,021 --> 02:17:10,731
This is your time.

141
02:17:11,772 --> 02:17:13,734
He must be in his own time -
