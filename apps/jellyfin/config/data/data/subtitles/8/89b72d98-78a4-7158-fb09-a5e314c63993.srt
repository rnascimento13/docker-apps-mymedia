1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,521
Fuck! We're gone a few days

2
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,315
and the Snyderverse people
took over.

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,526
Yeah! Screw the patriarchy!

4
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,986
And this car!

5
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,280
-Nora?
-Wait, Ivy?

6
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,490
[gasps] Oh, my God!
Where have you been?

7
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:33,658
Oh. Hey, Harley.

8
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:40,081
[singing in Italian]

9
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,584
Okay. What the fuck
is going on?

10
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,837
Nice of you two hos to finally
join us for the apocalypse.

11
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,672
Wait? It's already happened.

12
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,175
Oh! We'll just go back
in the time-sphere
and go back a week.

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,302
[both gasp]

14
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,847
[theme music playing]

15
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,434
[accordion music playing]

16
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,317
[grumbling]

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,824
Hey! Pasta-maker makers beware.

18
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,869
I have arrived!

19
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:22,082
Receptionisto!
I was on hold with you
for 94 hours

20
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:24,501
and after realizing
that seemed futile,

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,879
I came to speak with you
mano-a-mano.

22
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,215
[In Italian accent] Do you have
an appointimento?

23
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,592
No, I do not have appointmento.

24
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,012
I was stuck
in Homeland Security
for months.

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,181
Then in customs,
also for months.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,726
Then my mask tubes
got tangled
in your olive branches

27
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,145
for uncountable hours.
[groans softly]

28
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:49,609
And now I will finally
complete my quest to win
my coworker's affections

29
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,947
by fixing the handle
of her boss' pasta maker.

30
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,824
That handle is discontinuato.

31
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,911
Discontinued! Unacceptable!
[sighs wearily]

32
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,538
What about in the back?

33
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,415
Sometimes a store
doesn't think
they have something.

34
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,710
Then they check in the back
and they're like,
"Well, there it is."

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,919
It is a-not in the back.

36
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,294
You do not understand.

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,590
My whole life,
I have existed in darkness,

38
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,843
hopeless that I would
find someone

39
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,930
who connects with me
on an emotional
and spiritual level.

40
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,099
Well, I have found her...

41
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,518
My lovely Nora.

42
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,603
But if I don't find
a new handle
for this pasta maker,

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,772
I will lose her.

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,400
Discontinuato.

45
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,488
Pasta pricks!

[disco music playing]

47
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,536
Marcos, you're the only
IRS auditor worth a damn!

48
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,414
Good luck
with the promotion, buddy.
You deserve it.

49
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,668
[belches] Ah!

50
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,837
Take that, suckas.

51
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,839
In other news,
Lex Luthor has announced

52
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,134
he's about to start repairing
the ozone layer

53
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:59,095
with the Earth Saver by Lex.

54
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,972
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. Luthor.

55
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,682
Jesus, Elvis,

56
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,225
Rihanna's baby.

57
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,895
And now, Lex Luthor.

58
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,439
When the pages of history
look back on today...

59
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,232
Oh! I'm too excited.

60
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,359
Let's go.

[laser whooshes]

62
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,285
-What did you do?
-Sir,

63
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,787
it appears our
maximum laser range

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,373
is 304cm short
of the Earth's atmosphere.

65
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,500
In English!

66
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,710
It's about 10ft short, sir.

67
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,670
[grunts]

68
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,338
[screams]

69
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:42,305
I will find you an even better
pasta maker handle.

70
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,809
[speaking in Italian accent]
Excuzi me-zee, Italian man.

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,021
Can you tell me
where I can find
the best pasta maker

72
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,815
in all of Italy?

73
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,732
[snoring]

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,738
These people
and their fucking naps!

76
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,869
Hola, bambinos.

00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,956
It's a me, Bahn-io.

78
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,501

79
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,837
[all laughing]

80
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,714
Indeed.

81
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,759
Where do I find
the best pasta maker
in all of Italy?

82
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,386
Eh, pasta maker.

83
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,180
Grazie, Mille!

84
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,098
Huh?

85
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,019
Damn you, street urchins!

Every blister is worth it,
my sweet Nora!

Nora!

-[Lenny] Nora. Nora.
-[Nora laughs mischievously]

91
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,741
Hmm.

92
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,077
It's so much hotter
when someone's sleeping
in the same room.

93
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,620
How is she even comfortable?

94
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,873
Did someone say comfortable?

95
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,335
Ooh. Can't wait to get
my tongue stuck to that.

96
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,337
[both moan]

97
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,715
Actually, before we
get into it,
I need a bowl of pasta.

98
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
BRB.

99
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,177
[sputtering] Oh, yeah.
Yeah, me too.

100
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,720
It's always been
a dream of mine

101
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,431
to simultaneously explode
all the volcanoes on Earth.

102
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,141
Ivy's going to be so proud.

103
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,267
She recommended you.

104
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,102
What the fuck is going on here?

105
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,520
I was asked to help Lex with--

106
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,064
Can it, lava lips!

107
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,440
I wanna hear it from him.

108
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,651
Oh, I'm just borrowing
a low-level employee

109
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,862
to activate some volcanoes
around the world,

110
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,656
creating enough heat
to raise the ozone up...

111
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,658
Oh, I don't know,
ten-ish feet.

112
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,785
It doesn't matter why.

113
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,620
Seems like it does matter why.

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,538
This doesn't concern you, Nora.

115
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,459
Oh? A nefarious
business tycoon, comes
into the office on a Sunday

116
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,336
to take a
wet-behind-the-ears rube,

117
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,879
to help with
a personal project.

118

All my alarm bells
are going off, buster!

119
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,092
Oh, no! Am I in trouble?

120
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,134
I thought Ivy knew.

121
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,594
Is she gonna be mad at me or--

122
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,304
Why are you even here
on a Sunday?

123
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,014
I always work weekends.

124
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,643
Ugh! Go back to your nerd hole.
And put your headphones on.

125
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,978
It's about to get nasty
in here.

126
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,313
Not so fast!

127
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,731
Explain yourself.

128
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,733
I thought that she was
doing that press tour

129
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,985
for her line
of business corsets
with the Jons.

130
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,904
Ivy's not working
with the Jons anymore.

131
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,365
She blew them to smithereens,
you slippery son of a--

132
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,366
She did what?

133
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,826
God, you men!

134
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,661
You drain our titties
when you're baby boys

135
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,830
and now you're making us
run your companies?

136
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,956
Get out!

137
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,582

138
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,086
Knock, knock.

00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,132

[speaking Italian]

145
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,855
Apologies, Signora.

146
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,316
I wandered onto your property
on my botched search

147
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,862
for the best pasta maker
in all of Italy.

148
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,906
[speaking in Italian accent]
You have found her, beefy man.

149
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,159
A-ha!

150
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,163

what that twat Lex tried to do.

151
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,414
Okay, seriously, wake up.

152

You've been sleeping
for, like, days.

00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,753
-You're not Ivy!
-[groans]

155
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,421
Enough with
the wig shenanigans.

156
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,381
Ivy's not even there.

157
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,383
All right, Lexinators,
move in.

158
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,552
Aren't you worried
about Ivy?

159
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,803
No one's heard from her.

160
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,347
Yeah, feels like
a Monday problem.

161
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,681
Now, where were we?

What are you doing?

00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,942

of Ivy's random hairs
and chip crumbs?

No one has work-life
boundaries anymore.

We're being trolled
by a petty-ass bald himbo

from getting laid!

Come on, Lenny.

179
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,808
Let's continue this in my car.

180
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,401
-[belches]
-Ew!

181
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,194
Grazie, Signora.

182
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,573
I will never forget
your act of
international kindness.

183
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,242
No freeloading.

184
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,785
You eat my parmesan,

185
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,328
you help in the kitchen, huh?

186
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,579
[whining] I need rest!

187
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,416
I'm afraid my body
will fail me!

188
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,127
Now is not the time for fear.

189
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,421
Fear comes-ah later.

190
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,797
After dessert?

191
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,299
Silencio! I ask the questions.

192
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,261
-You make-a the dough
or out you get-a.
-[groans]

193
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,682
Shit, shit, shit!
What the shit
are we gonna do?

194
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,976
Can't you use your powers
to explode us out of here?

195
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,895
I'm famously known for fires,
not explosions.

196
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,148
It's a subtle but very
important distinction.

197
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,941
[Lex on intercom]
Ivy's underlings,

198
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,651
you have one last chance
to hand over Volcana.

199
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,403
I wish Ivy were here.

200
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,779
Well, she's not!

201
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,073
And the line of succession
I just decided on

202
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,324
says I'm in charge.

203
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,452
[Lex] Nora,

204
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,704
I take your silence
as a refusal to hand over
the fire breather?

205
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,330
Uh-huh. That's right.

206
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,833
I've seen men like you
take young, nerdy women before.

207
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,168
Well, not on my watch!

208
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,419
Aw! Thank you, Nora.

209
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,212
Will someone put her
in the panic room already!

210
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,214
The LOD doesn't have
a panic room.

211
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,134
God, I can't deal
with all these personalities.

212
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,510
Don't worry, work fam.

213
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,637
Time for this shark to shine.

214
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,848
I'm gonna hack us out of here.

215
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,100
[exhilarating music playing]

216
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
Can you get into
Ivy's bank account?

217
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,521
I wanna know
what that bitch makes.

218
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,316
Quick. Someone get me something
with taurine in it.

219
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,236
I would not call it
love at first sight.

220
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,199
What I have with Nora
is much deeper.

221
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,285
Hey! We work with the hands,
not the mouth.

222
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,789
You are being
quite rough with me.

223
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,376
Oh! It is passion! It is life!

224
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,002
-Ow.
-Now, focus.

225
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,343
Okay, little egg. Crack!

226
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,260
[Bane grumbles]

227
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,059
Your eggs are faulty!
I will 'splode them all!

228
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,268
Argh!

229
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,728
[hen clucks]

230
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,731
Give to me a photo
of your beloved.

231
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,236
Now you try.

232
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,947
[groans softly] Okay.
But I will assuredly break her

233
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,742
like I have so many bodies
and spirits in my career.

234
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,621
Not if you break it for her.

235
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,632
[exclaims]

236
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,766
Think of this dough
as like a bosoms
of your Nora.

237
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,644
[chuckles nervously] Oh, my.

238
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,064
Uh, like... like this?

239
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,107
Perfecto.

240
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,526
Um, don't forget to play
with the nipples.

241
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,903
[chuckles softly] Oh, well.

242
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,156
Again. You must
do it yourself.

243
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,992
In my kitchen,
there is no rope!

244
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,994
[sighs wearily]

245
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,634
I can't!

246
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,346
You can! Look at our hands.

247
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,014
They are not so different.

248
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,142
Yes, each of yours is like
five little sausage,

249
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,728
stuck to a fresh ball
of mozzerella.

250
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,689
But they can still do
delicate work.

251
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,942
Hmm. Assembling my bombs
for 'splosions

252
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,488
has always required
a nimble touch, I suppose.

253
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,697
Yes!

254
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,240
Think of each fettuccine

255
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,660
as a, um,
'splosive of feelings
for your Nora.

256
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,204
Now, cut.

257
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,375
[Bane grunting]

258
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,335
Too thick! Again!

259
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:06,059
Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora!

260
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,063
[slurping]

261
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,148
[groaning] My dick's
gonna fall off
waiting for you.

262
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,111
Look, I took this job hoping
there'd be way more
villainous IT emergencies,

263
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,863
not just helping folks
do their timecard online.

264
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,116
Finally, this is my moment!

265
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,076
This is fascinating
watching you.

266
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,204
Hey! That's supposed to be
my sensual neck massage!

267
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,125
I'm trying to keep
my guy loose.
And I'm learning so much.

268
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,086
[mimicking gunshots]

269
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:37,007
I can't die watching
two men bond over tech.

270
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,842
Of course! The Imbigulator!

271
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,552
We can use this
to make the building bigger

272
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,761
and the armor will pop off.

273
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,222
No! Nora, I need this.

274
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,392
-It's my time to prove
I'm more than just a dad.
-[laptop chimes]

275
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,728
And... ooh, la, la!

276
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,188
I just got through
another firewall.

277
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,525
A few more minutes
and we are good, to--

278
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,237
Oh! I've been Imbigulated!

279
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,615
-I can't hack like this!
-Ah, crap. It's single use.

280
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,159
[rooster crows]

281
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,334
Wake up!

282
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,252
Time for mangia!

283
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,046
Oh, I love pasta.

284
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,423
Meele gratzis, Signora.

285
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,674
No! Not Signora.

286
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,802
You call me Mama.
Mama Nacaroni.

287
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,679
Like Mama... Macaroni?

288
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,433
Yes, my cousin's ristorante.

289
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,061
Our name is-a Nacaroni.

290
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,229
But they changed it
at Ellis Island.

291
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,568
This is the most delicious
pasta I have ever had.

292
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,778
Who made this?

293
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,695
You did.

294
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,655
What? When?

295
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:49,287
Il buffone , you are the
second greatest pasta maker
in all of Italy.

296
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,374
I am the pasta maker?

297
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,168
Mama, I may have been
born in a prison,

298
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,254
but I have been living
in a prison of my own
making,

299
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,590
the warden,
my self-doubt.

300
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:04,969
I have become the thing
that I sought!

301
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,389
Thank you, Mama.

302
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,978
[King Shark]
Will you look at these mitts?

303
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,814
How am I gonna to drive home?

304
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,315
Oh, fuck!

305
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,651
My babysitter must be
in triple overtime by now.

306
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,279
How many times have I asked you
not to mention children
in my presence?

307
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,948
[Lex] Enough with your
female antics!

308
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,076
It's time to...
turn up the heat.

309
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,412
[whooshes]

310
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,248
He said it like a pun,
but that's what he
literally did.

311
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,250
How embarrassing!
[chuckles softly]

312
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,168
[Lex] And I didn't mean
it as a pun.

313
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,170
It's a double entendre,
if anything!
But that's irrelevant

314
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,672
because I meant the turn on
the poison vapor.

315
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,257
[yelling] Where the fuck
is the poison vapor?

316
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,675
No, it's not in my car.

317
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,260
I thought it was in your car.

318
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,845
Well, go and get it!

319
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,680
Ugh! My pits are gushing.

320
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,265
I'll cool you down, baby.

321
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,726
Heat is my most
despised nemesis.

322
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,893
Ooh, yes. Ooh!

323
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,895
Do my elbows.
[moans]

324
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,981
[both moaning]

325
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,983
[exclaiming] Get me
out of here!

326
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,444
-[vapor whooshes]
-[Lex] Ah! There we go.

327
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,362
-You! Cover that vent.
-No can do.

328
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,156
It's too high up.

329
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,742
Why can't any of you just,
like, get big and tall
and be impervious to gas?

330
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,869
Can you at least
create an explosion
to get us out of here?

331
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,954
I can make you an iced coffee?

332
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,665
[groans softly] God!
Where's that 'splosions guy
when you need a 'splosion?

333
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,083
You mean Bane?

334
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,543
Oh, now I'm supposed to learn
everyone's names?

335
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,586
[scoffs] Okay.

336
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,923
[Bane humming]

337
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:28,261
Do you think you could part
with a wedge of parm
for my trip home, Mama?

338
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,012
Home?

339
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,847
Si, Mama.

340
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,725
I now return to Gotham
with all the secrets and wisdom
I learned

341
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,395
in our short, but meaningful
time together.

342
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,731
Hairy vaderchy!

343
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,441
-No.
-Huh?

344
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,153
Now, you will take over
my business
and be my heir.

345
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,072
But Mama,
you fixed my problems,

346
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,823
so I don't need you any--
[groans]

347
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,077
Madre di puttana!
You cannot
come to this country,

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,371

You're a cultural tourist!
What now?

350
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,918
You're gonna sell my story
to some asshole
at a streaming service.

351
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,253
Mama, let's be reasonable.

352
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,675
You think I would
teach you a craft I spent-a
my whole life perfecting

353
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,426
and expect nothing in return?

under my leadership,

00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,604
we're gonna do it looking
like fucking supermodels!

359
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,232
This is where I stash
all the hair products,
diet snacks,

360
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,401
and little pink guns
that brands send to Ivy

361
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,777
hoping to get her endorsement.

362
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,071
And it's also where I put
that volcano girl.

363
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,531
[all exclaiming] Oh, fuck!

364
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,909
Oh, thank, Mount Vesuvius!

365
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,285
Why'd you lock me in here?

366
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,037
I told you it wasn't
a panic room!

367
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,622
You're alive, aren't you?

368
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,665
Ooh, gas masks!

Ooh, gum!

[Volcana] This is literally
the most flammable closet
in all of Gotham.

371
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,674
Hairspray, gunpowder,

372
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,427
snacks made with
highly-combustible ingredients.

373
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,762
I'm lucky I didn't explode!

374
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,681
Explode, like an explosion?

375

-Yes.
-Hmm.

What? No!

You will pay the price
for your insolence

379
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,987
with death.

380
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,323
Can't we sit and talk this out
over an aperitivo?

381
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,992
Mama! Not my fingers!

382
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,662
I need these
to pleasure Nora...

with my calligraphy!

384
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,792
And to continue working
as a semi-famous villain
in Gotham!

385
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,588
Wait. You are semi-famous?

386
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,923
Clayface? Hi.

387
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,467
It's... It's me, Bane.

388
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,845
No, Bane.
From 'sploding things?

389
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,347
Yes!

390
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,516
So, look. My former mentor
has me at knife point,

391
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,437
and she's demanding tickets
to your Vegas show.

-Front row, she says.

Um...

394
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,693
You want me
to head-butt Poison Ivy

395
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:52,322
on the Gotham News live
just to embarrass her?

396
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,449
But she's my Nora's boss...

397
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,160
You've got a deal.

398
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,497
Bravo, Il Buffone.

399
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,498
Ugh!

-Paint guns!

00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,551
I can carry so much stuff
with these big hands.

403
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,388
Look! I'm holdin' like
20 diet sodas.

404
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,306
Someone take a pic!

405
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,849
Might as well throw this
in there.

406
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,434
I don't know how to put it
back on the wall.

407
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,687
Wow, this is just like
Die Hard.

408
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,563
Oh, the over-referenced
action movie

409
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,607

into oblivion?

410

Well, not today!

Mr. Luthor, an explosion
in Gotham imbigulated
the atmosphere

417
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,350
and pushed it 304cm...

418

I mean, 10ft higher.

419
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,105
We are now in range
to regenerate the ozone.

Farewell, little thief boy!

00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,882
I am going home
to my dear Nora.

Ah! So bellissimo.

Pretty sure we all have
concussions,

430

but I slept great.

00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,251
Should we get bagels?

432
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,587
We still have no idea
where Ivy is.

When's the swelling
gonna go down?

434
