1
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:51,927
On your feet!

2
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,241
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,535
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,209
You were alone?

5
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,755
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,340
I like to be alone.

7
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,427
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,722
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,223
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,019
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

11
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,438
"To the victor"?

12
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,940
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,734
The Führer's in hiding.

14
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,695
You lost.

15
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,034
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,452
What? What?

17
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,578
Hey!

18
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,829
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

19
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,289
A moment. Please!

20
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,583
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

21
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,752
Colonel. I found it!

22
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,214
Do as he says. Open it.

23
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,605
The Lance of Longinus.

24
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,442
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

25
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,569
The Holy Lance.

26
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,040
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

27
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,083
Colonel, we need to talk.

28
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,417
No time, Doctor.

29
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,044
The train to Berlin is waiting.

30
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,296
Search the woods!

31
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,381
Take the dogs.

32
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,925
Do you think that spy was alone?

33
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,052
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

34
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,095
On the double!

35
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,540
Looks like they're leaving without you guys.

36
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,960
Tell us your story, or die.

37
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,587
Story.

38
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,798
Okay, okay.

39
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:35,924
Well...

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,302
it all started...

41
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:43,056
once upon a time,
when this village...

42
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,644
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together...

43
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,106
and follow this sweaty little pied piper
named Adolf...

44
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,252
No.

45
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,000
This man was with the American.

46
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,836
This is the American's bag.

47
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,672
What have I done?

48
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,595
Bring him to my carriage.

49
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,272
Careful. This is the Führer's special relic!

50
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,136
Stay seated.

51
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,347
So...

52
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,143
you are a birdwatcher?

53
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,690
Yes. Because of the bombing,

54
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,610
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

55
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,282
We caught your accomplice.

56
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,993
The American.

57
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,560
Oh, my!

58
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,004
Get off of me!

59
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,952
There's one reason you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

60
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,164
Who sent you?

61
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,499
What was your mission?

62
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,668
Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.

63
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,128
My name is Basil Shaw.

64
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,048
I'm a professor at Oxford.

65
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,842
An archeologist.

66
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,517
There you are.

67
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,690
There is a problem.

68
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,025
I must speak to the Colonel.

69
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,319
It's urgent.

70
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,615
I have a daughter. I beg you.

71
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,952
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

72
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,250
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

73
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,943
We were told that the Lance of Longinus
could be found at the fortress.

74
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,737
We were looking for it.

75
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,780
Why?

76
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,408
Because of its power?

77
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,245
It has no power.

78
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,501
My friend and I were trying to save history.

79
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,588
I must speak with the Colonel.

80
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,924
It's about the Lance.

81
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,055
I only had a moment to look at it.

82
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,974
Of course, my training is in physics,

83
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,434
For God's sake, spit it out!

84
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,229
The Lance...

85
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,650
It's a fake.

86
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,068
It's a fake.

87
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,653
A fake?

88
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,448
The blade is an alloy.

89
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,950
Fifty years old,

90
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,286
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

91
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,412
We're dead.

92
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,542
Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.

93
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,836
Ramesses II.

94
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,964
None of this stuff is fake.

95
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,385
I gotta stop this train.

96
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,053
There is another relic on this train.

97
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,639
One with real power.

98
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,224
What are you talking about?

99
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,186
The Antikythera.

100
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:08,562
The Antikythera?!

101
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,814
Enough about that old dial!

102
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,233
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

103
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,027
and his mind!

104
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,572
Let me explain.

105
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,035
The Antikythera's power is not supernatural.

106
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,370
It is mathematics.

107
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,582
Whoever harnesses it...

108
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,169
will not be King...

109
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,921
nor Emperor...

110
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,507
or Führer.

111
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,803
He will be God.

112
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,865
Too many Nazis.

113
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,330
And how do you propose we tell him this?

114
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:09,706
My Führer,

115
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,417
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

116
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,836
But here is...

117
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,006
half of something you've never heard of.

118
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,509
Tell me,

119
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,469
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

120
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,139
A saboteur aboard.

121
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,641
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

122
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,225
That way!

123
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,189
What are you doing here?!

124
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,322
What the hell?

125
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,200
Indy?

126
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,201
Baz?

127
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,535
You're alive!

128
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,245
So far.

129
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,332
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

130
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,586
What sort of a man hides in a hedge
while his friend is facing death?

131
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:54,520
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

132
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,731
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

133
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,816
Did you at least find the Lance?

134
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,069
-"At least"?
-Well, have you got it?

135
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,403
It's a fake.

136
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,404
What?

137
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,406
A reproduction.

138
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:09,910
Who are you?

139
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,499
Indy?

140
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,843
The Antikythera.

141
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,679
Archimedes' Dial.

142
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,223
Bring it.

143
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,075
Hurry up, Baz.

144
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,371
Give me that.

145
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,664
Come on.

146
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,889
Get up, Baz.

147
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,265
Follow me.

148
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,225
Towards the gun?

149
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,685
Away from the Nazis!

150
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,062
Those are Nazis!

151
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,607
Get down! Down! Down!

152
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,031
This way. Come on!

153
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,617
I can't do that!

154
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,702
You wanna stop for a little lie-down?

155
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,874
They have the Antikythera!

156
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,292
Easy.

157
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,200
Tunnel!

158
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,546
Got you! No!

159
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,213
Indy!

160
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,472
Get the gun!

161
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,066
Shoot him!

162
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,070
Not me!

163
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,197
Sorry.

164
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,510
To the victor go the spoils.

165
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,209
Drop the gun.

166
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,505
Give me the Antikythera.

167
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,976
Indy!

168
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,779
Hey!

169
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,202
-Here!
-They can't hear you, Baz.

170
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,120
We gotta jump!

171
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,622
What about my dicky knee?

172
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:54,588
Baz!

173
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,507
Baz!

174
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,384
Baz!

175
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,387
-Indy!
-Baz!

176
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,186
Go! Move! Move it!

177
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,815
Bit rum to go home empty-handed
after all that.

178
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,609
"Empty-handed"?

179
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,152
Not exactly.

180
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,031
Archimedes' Dial.

181
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,241
Well, half of it.

182
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,618
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

183
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,603
Larry! Turn it down!

184
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,897
Turn it down!

185
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,899
Hey, Larry!

186
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,623
Larry!

187
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,000
Larry!

188
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,752
-Hi, Mr. Jones.
-Where's Larry?

189
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:58,795
Who is this guy?

190
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,088
It's the old guy next door.

191
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,882
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

192
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,426
-"It's 8:00 in the morning."
-We talked about this, Larry.

193
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:05,552
Yeah, but that was...

194
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,180
-a workday, Mr. Jones.
-This is a workday too, Larry!

195
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,724
Turn on the news.

196
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,267
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

197
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,603
Moon day?

198
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,824
Thanks.

199
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,256
All you really need to remember...

200
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:28,010
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized...

201
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:32,139
by this complex blue-line pattern.

202
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,307
Okay?

203
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,769
I assigned pages 131 through 171...

204
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,563
in Winford for today.

205
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,231
Anybody do the reading?

206
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:44,526
Anyone?

207
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,364
Gosh, this is on the test.

208
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,741
Okay.

209
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,952
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

210
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,458
In 213 BC...

211
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,627
Roman forces led by Marcellus...

212
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,630
laid siege to the city of Syracuse.

213
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,465
"Syracuse."

214
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,511
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.

215
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,262
The one in Sicily.

216
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,432
Amongst the defenders of the city...

217
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,685
was its most famous resident, who was...

218
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,606
Come on, guys. This is on the final.

219
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,900
Archimedes.

220
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:26,818
Archimedes.

221
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,320
Archimedes, who was a...

222
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:29,613
A mathematician.

223
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,948
A mathematician.

224
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,700
But more than that, an inventor...

225
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,370
a brilliant engineer...

226
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:40,874
who conceived of a way to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun...

227
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,752
on concave mirrors and focus it...

228
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,588
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

229
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,217
Who devised giant iron claws...

230
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,970
that could snatch hostiles from the sea.

231
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,433
But how do we know it really happened?

232
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,564
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence...

233
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,067
-is there of these inventions?
-The Antikythera.

234
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,612
-The Antikythera.
-For starters.

235
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,781
They're here! They're downtown!

236
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,076
The astronauts.

237
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,579
<i>Giant parade this morning will be seen...</i>

238
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,874
<i>by about two and a half million people
lining the sidewalks...</i>

239
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,336
He's coming. He's come. See?

240
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,921
Oh, here he comes.

241
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:29,882
Hide the cake.

242
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,677
-Surprise.
-Surprise!

243
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:38,974
For over a decade now...

244
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:43,645
our colleague Dr. Jones has been
a loyal servant of Hunter.

245
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,648
A token of our gratitude.

246
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:54,907
Wow.

247
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,246
Thanks for putting up with me.

248
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:16,470
Here.

249
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,232
<i>Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
and Buzz Aldrin...</i>

250
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,359
<i>will not be able to avoid the spotlight.</i>

251
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:34,238
<i>At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
a grateful nation will pay homage...</i>

252
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,032
<i>with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago...</i>

253
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,700
<i>climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...</i>

254
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,202
What would the ancients say?

255
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,454
<i>Neil, Buzz, and Mike...</i>

256
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,374
If they knew we walked on the moon?

257
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,084
Speaking as an ancient...

258
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,711
going to the moon is like going to Reno.

259
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,171
Middle of nowhere...

260
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,841
and no blackjack.

261
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,510
You don't recognize me, do you?

262
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,889
Whatever I did, I apologize.

263
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,891
It's Helena.

264
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:05,519
Helena Shaw.

265
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,564
Wombat?

266
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,399
Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.

267
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,651
-You got tall.
-I did.

268
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,111
It's fair to say.

269
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,322
I'm celebrating.

270
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,659
-I'm retiring.
-Oh.

271
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,661
Wow.
Well, in that case, what are we drinking?

272
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,835
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

273
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,307
Put that away.

274
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,309
I was asking how you broke your ankle.

275
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,019
None of your business.

276
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,103
Are you Mr. Schmidt?

277
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,397
"Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.

278
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:53,358
And he don't eat anything on wheels,
so put it on a table.

279
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,111
<i>When I was a little boy...</i>

280
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:57,779
<i>I always imagined...</i>

281
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,658
<i>that one day man would walk on the moon.</i>

282
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,327
<i>And by golly...</i>

283
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,668
Quite a celebration out there.

284
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,548
The man you're servin'...

285
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:19,009
he's the one who put those astronauts
on the moon.

286
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,219
Built the rockets they rode in.

287
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:22,888
Congratulations.

288
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,181
Where are you from?

289
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,058
The Bronx, sir.

290
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:28,185
No, no. I mean originally, your people.

291
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:29,353
Do you know?

292
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,692
I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.

293
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,113
And you fought for your country?

294
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,491
320th Battalion.

295
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:45,035
Set up balloons to stop the planes
bombing Normandy.

296
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,376
And are you enjoying your victory?

297
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,260
Will there be anything else?

298
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,013
You didn't win the war.

299
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,808
Hitler lost it.

300
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,273
Yeah.

301
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,235
My field agent, she found Shaw.

302
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:20,445
Yeah, I'm comin'.

303
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,613
Let's go, Hauke.

304
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,201
Where are we here?

305
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,204
Oxford. In the garden.

306
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,374
He was an original.

307
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,211
I just graduated.

308
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:37,379
In Archeology.

309
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,465
Archeology. Wow.

310
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,176
Apple didn't fall far.

311
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,053
Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.

312
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:47,264
What's your subject?

313
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,058
The Archimedes Dial.

314
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:52,144
The Antikythera.

315
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,440
What do you know about that?

316
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,317
Well, for starters...

317
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,862
in 1902, Greek sponge divers found
a wrecked Roman warship...

318
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,405
huge, off the coast of Greece.

319
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,741
Below deck, sealed in wax...

320
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:07,451
was a clock-like mechanism...

321
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,412
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

322
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:14,541
Nothing approximating its complexity appears
in the world for 1,000 years.

323
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,836
-You've done your homework.
-Well, not me.

324
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,006
Dad. He had all these journals,
reams of notes about it.

325
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,008
He was obsessed till the end.

326
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,847
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

327
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,393
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

328
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,356
Well, that was a long time ago.

329
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,982
And it was only half the Dial.

330
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,692
-Archimedes...
-Archimedes broke the Dial in two...

331
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:41,818
-...disassembled it.
-...and then hid...

332
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,987
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

333
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,364
I know. Look.

334
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,367
You don't remember the last time I saw you,
do you?

335
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,119
Remember what?

336
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,204
These are the Alps.

337
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,249
Yeah, I see.

338
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,251
And this is the route that your train took...

339
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,378
-from the Nazi stronghold in '44.
-Right.

340
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,338
It went through this mountain pass...

341
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,006
and then here.

342
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,384
-Here, it's the only river on the route.
-Right.

343
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:06,635
Under a bridge.

344
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,178
It's down there. It's got to be.

345
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,764
-And nobody knows except us.
-"Us"?

346
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:12,558
Well, I mean, you.

347
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,268
And me. So, yeah.

348
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,270
-Us.
-Us.

349
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,773
And what were you thinking exactly?

350
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,317
Well, that maybe...

351
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,696
we could go there.

352
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:26,905
And?

353
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,156
And find it.

354
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,701
And I'd become...

355
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,495
famous.

356
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:34,955
Oh, well, not famous.

357
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:35,956
Renowned. Feted.

358
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,333
A feted archeologist.

359
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,252
And you, a final triumph!

360
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,336
Indiana Jones!

361
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,547
Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!

362
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,010
I'm not selling this, am I?

363
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:51,722
Wombat...

364
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,684
why are you chasing the thing...

365
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,521
that drove your father crazy?

366
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,904
Wouldn't you?

367
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,089
I got it.

368
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:27,216
Parade's comin' soon.

369
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,259
So, what we got?

370
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,388
She's in there, third floor, with an old guy.

371
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,681
Who is he, a Russian?

372
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,767
No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.

373
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:38,852
Klaber!

374
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,438
Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!

375
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,898
Goddammit!
Go.

376
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:45,651
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

377
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,548
This way.

378
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,795
Basil became obsessed by this German theory.

379
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,715
Conjecture, really.

380
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,553
Archimedes had figured out...

381
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,972
that the movements of the moon and planets...

382
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,057
weren't perfect.

383
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,811
There were irregularities in their rotations.

384
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,273
He thought these irregularities might...

385
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,818
explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.

386
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,238
Storms, even.

387
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,492
So, he set about building a device
to predict them.

388
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:23,123
But then, he stumbled upon a method
to predict even larger...

389
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:24,875
disturbances.

390
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,170
Larger disturbances?

391
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,006
Your father thought this thing could...

392
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,967
predict fissures in time.

393
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,486
Hauke, if you don't...

394
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:55,989
Found 'em.

395
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:05,582
Hello.

396
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,002
Are you looking for...

397
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,337
Dr. Jones?

398
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,259
Excuse me, can I help you?

399
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:16,760
No, thank you.

400
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:18,637
Just a routine investigation, ma'am.

401
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,224
Are you the police?

402
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,725
It'll just be a few moments.

403
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,727
-Professor Plimpton.
-Ma'am.

404
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,020
-Professor Plimpton!
-Ma'am!

405
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:32,401
Drop your weapon.

406
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:33,777
What the hell are you doin'?

407
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,155
What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.

408
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,198
Mandy?

409
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,997
Yeah, no witnesses.

410
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,461
Jesus. What the hell?

411
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:55,048
Your father wrote so many letters
about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.

412
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:00,888
You really don't remember the last time
I was at your house?

413
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,725
I took that from him then.

414
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,061
I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.

415
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:12,107
But your father was convinced this thing
was real and dangerous.

416
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,234
Do not shoot.

417
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:18,071
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

418
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,364
the Grafikos...

419
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,700
The tablet containing directions
to the rest of the Dial.

420
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:22,993
And if they found the Grafikos...

421
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,703
they might acquire the other half
of the Dial...

422
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,704
and put the two together.

423
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,582
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

424
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,046
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?

425
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,380
What?

426
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,924
You do remember that night.

427
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:41,094
-I was 12 years old, Indy.
-You knew we didn't drop it in a river.

428
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,013
Baz didn't tell you that.

429
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,182
-See, listen. I didn't...
-No, he never lied.

430
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:48,101
-No. You...
-What was all that crap about the map?

431
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,311
No, you've had too many whiskeys.

432
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,104
What are you doing, Wombat?

433
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,439
Stay where you are.

434
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:54,816
Don't move.

435
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,027
-Who are these people?
-We need to get out of here.

436
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,028
Are they with you?

437
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,363
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

438
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:01,698
Miss Shaw, stop!

439
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:05,911
Helena!

440
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,167
Stop!

441
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,170
Sorry.

442
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:16,129
Helena!

443
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,173
Dr. Jones. It's over.

444
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,550
Who are you people?

445
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:20,801
What do you want?

446
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:23,637
Stop!

447
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:26,640
Helena Shaw!

448
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,058
She's on the roof. Find another way up.

449
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,059
Dr. Jones!

450
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,270
Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.

451
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:00,299
-Move. We gotta follow 'em.
-Go. Hurry up.

452
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:28,702
Fan out!

453
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,259
-All right, let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!
-Come on. Get everything.

454
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:45,552
Found her!

455
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:16,291
<i>-Operator.
</i>-I need the police.

456
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,752
Hunter College. People are dead.

457
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,003
-Please...
-Hang up, fella.

458
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:26,802
Stand up.

459
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,392
Okay, okay.

460
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,334
She's gone. You blew it...

461
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,752
you trigger-happy cracker.

462
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,380
-She had it in her hand.
-We got the professor.

463
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,135
Here's the file on Jones.

464
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,219
Yes.

465
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,530
Who are you?

466
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,157
That's my question.

467
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,127
You're CIA.

468
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,046
Oh, not me, man.

469
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,173
I don't take government jobs.

470
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,174
Okay.

471
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,886
How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?

472
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,513
She's my goddaughter.

473
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,890
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

474
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:57,226
Why did you meet with her today?
To give her the Dial?

475
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:01,063
Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.

476
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:02,981
Half a hunk.

477
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,858
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

478
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:07,653
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

479
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,071
Where do you think you're going?

480
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,614
I got a parade going on.

481
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,241
And a demonstration coming down here.

482
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,450
Hey! Hey, hey!

483
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,160
-Hey...
-Shut up.

484
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:17,746
I can't go this way. Gotta go back.

485
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,503
Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?

486
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,296
Damn it!
Let's go on foot.

487
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:27,297
You heard her.

488
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:30,217
What the hell were you thinking?

489
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,677
-Walk! Come on.
-What is your problem?

490
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,345
-You don't look when you're backin' up?
-Take care of that guy.

491
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:34,304
Who's gonna pay for that?

492
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,639
Easy, fella. Easy.

493
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:36,557
Keep movin'.

494
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,433
Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.

495
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,602
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man. I don't...

496
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,440
Peace now! Peace now!

497
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,695
Stop the war! Stop the fighting!

498
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,613
-Where are we going, Mason?
-This way.

499
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:55,242
-Hell no, we won't go.
-Shut up.

500
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,827
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no!

501
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,746
-Hell no, we won't go!
<i>-</i>Hell no, we won't go!

502
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:00,789
We won't go!

503
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:03,333
-Hell no, we won't go!
<i>-</i>Hell no, we won't go!

504
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,335
-Hell no...
-Shut up!

505
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:06,503
Hell yeah!

506
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:17,556
Hell no...

507
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,318
Hey!

508
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:32,237
Officer! Help me!

509
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:34,489
Officer, there was a shooting...

510
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,491
-All right, all right.
-...this morning at Hunter.

511
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,410
People are dead. God damn it.

512
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,914
-Some rogue maniacs broke in and...
-Sir, you need to calm it down.

513
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,290
Please listen to me.

514
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,584
There was a shooting this morning, and the...

515
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:49,171
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

516
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,383
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

517
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:06,897
-Watch out!
-What's he doin'?

518
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:28,794
You did it!

519
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:57,114
Move, out the way!

520
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,123
Watch out!

521
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,626
Move! Quickly!

522
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,309
Move! Move!

523
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:37,279
Go, go, go!

524
00:45:57,883 --> 00:46:00,552
Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.

525
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:01,553
Come on!

526
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,891
-Hey, mister.
-Move! Out of the way!

527
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,059
Hold my horse.

528
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:08,352
Move! Move!

529
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,230
<i>Transfer is available
for IND Queens Boulevard.</i>

530
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,700
<i>Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.</i>

531
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:26,828
Subway is faster.

532
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:32,167
People tend to romanticize science,
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

533
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:33,836
So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?

534
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:35,879
Mars?

535
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,257
No, we've conquered space.

536
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:41,802
I'm moving to the next frontier.

537
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:45,681
What's beyond space?

538
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:52,312
You might wanna get that suit pressed,
Dr. Schmidt.

539
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,565
We leave for the airport in an hour.

540
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,024
He's gonna meet the President.

541
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,693
If the President objects to a few creases...

542
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,112
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

543
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:02,948
-Can I use that?
-No.

544
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:04,157
Yes.

545
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:06,743
Baxter.

546
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:11,832
It's for you, Doctor.

547
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,629
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

548
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:20,048
I'm expecting a delivery shortly.

549
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:24,136
Speak.

550
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:25,804
<i>Your goons made a mess.</i>

551
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,139
<i>Did they?</i>

552
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:29,725
Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.

553
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,102
She acquired the device from him.

554
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,104
<i>Then we lost her.</i>

555
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,441
<i>Dr. Jones got away as well.</i>

556
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:39,026
<i>Is that so?</i>

557
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,527
<i>Most unfortunate.</i>

558
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,487
I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.

559
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,907
<i>And as a representative
of the United States government...</i>

560
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:46,783
<i>I urge you to cooperate.</i>

561
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,160
<i>Get on that plane to Los Angeles...</i>

562
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:50,329
and get your medal from the President.

563
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:58,795
Hello?

564
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,715
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

565
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,051
To Morocco.

566
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:05,385
Yes, sir.

567
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:09,515
<i>The university murders took place
at the height of the parade.</i>

568
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:13,101
<i>Police are searching for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.</i>

569
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,271
<i>A colleague told ABC
that Jones recently lost his son...</i>

570
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:18,440
<i>and was in the middle of a divorce.</i>

571
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,862
This guy, he looks like you.

572
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:27,199
Nah. No.

573
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,160
It is you.

574
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:31,161
No, no, no. Hey.

575
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,829
-Go home, pal. You're drunk.
-This is the guy!

576
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,289
-Hey!
-It's the killer!

577
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,377
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

578
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:39,962
Bridge traffic.

579
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:53,016
Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.

580
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:55,853
I wish I could say the same, old friend.

581
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:01,066
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

582
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:07,155
Your goddaughter, Helena...

583
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:09,992
was arrested in Tangier last year...

584
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,911
for auctioning contraband.

585
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:16,331
There's more.

586
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:20,919
She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.

587
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,506
Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...

588
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:27,426
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

589
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:32,639
Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...

590
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,392
in Tangier, and this week...

591
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:39,688
the hotel is hosting its annual auction...

592
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,732
of stolen antiquities.

593
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,402
All the big players are already there.

594
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:47,362
Alia, Jabari.

595
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:51,700
This is the great man who brought our family
to America during the war.

596
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,244
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

597
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,788
1956.

598
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,624
Very impressive, Jabari.

599
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,210
My grandchildren watch too much TV...

600
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,921
but they know their history.

601
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:08,217
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

602
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,261
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.

603
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,848
If you run, the police will assume
that you're guilty.

604
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,894
Without Helena or the Dial,
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

605
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:21,688
Have you thought about calling Marion?

606
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:24,107
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

607
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,867
<i>Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.</i>

608
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,995
<i>The upper level is for Pan American Airlines
passenger drop off only.</i>

609
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,997
I took something else from your apartment.

610
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:40,374
It was under the bed.

611
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:46,630
Thanks, Sallah.

612
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,676
I also brought my passport.

613
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,929
I could help you.

614
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:55,013
In Tangier?

615
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,807
Wherever chance takes us.

616
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:58,809
Indy, I...

617
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:01,186
I miss the desert.

618
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,063
I miss the sea.

619
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,400
And I miss waking up every morning...

620
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:09,695
wondering what wonderful adventure
the new day will bring to us.

621
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:12,656
This is not an adventure, Sallah.

622
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:16,702
Those days have come and gone.

623
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:17,911
Perhaps.

624
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,413
Perhaps not.

625
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:26,503
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

626
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:38,974
Champagne?

627
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:41,435
We've got four more hours to Tangier.

628
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,611
Your scotch, sir.

629
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,237
Thanks.

630
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,537
<i>Basil. Come on, Baz!</i>

631
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,456
<i>-Open the door!
-No!</i>

632
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:04,124
<i>-Stay out, Indy!
</i>-Open the door.

633
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:09,213
The Germans were right, Indy.

634
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,673
-What?
-It's too big. It's too much.

635
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,674
Hey, Ba...
Hey, hey!

636
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,635
-Hey, Baz! Give me...
-No.

637
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,887
-What are you doing?
-You've listened to nothing that I said.

638
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:18,847
I don't understand it, Baz!

639
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:21,141
Well, I was trying to explain it
to you downstairs.

640
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,602
-You've just ignored everything.
-You're terrifying your daughter.

641
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,856
Indy, Archimedes...

642
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,234
discovered a temporal meteorology.

643
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:33,070
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...

644
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,446
not a magician.

645
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:37,074
He could predict fissures in time.

646
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,784
Fissures in time?

647
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:42,204
-Baz, you can't prove that!
-Well, not yet.

648
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,248
Proving it is what makes it science!

649
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:00,722
Oh, Baz.

650
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,976
I never should've given you the thing.

651
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,186
It belongs in a museum.

652
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:08,814
Give it to me. Please.

653
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:13,777
If I give you this...

654
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,446
it must be destroyed.

655
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:18,824
I will.

656
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,078
I'll destroy it, Baz.

657
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:26,582
Promise.

658
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:34,214
I'm sorry about this.

659
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,591
It's all my fault.

660
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,178
-Are you gonna be here?
-Yes, sir.

661
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,430
Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.

662
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,391
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

663
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:45,893
Some things should stay buried.

664
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:46,810
I know, Baz.

665
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,770
-It's vital that you destroy it.
-I will, Baz.

666
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,314
-Do you understand?
-I'll destroy it.

667
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,231
-Say you will, Indy.
-Yes.

668
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:52,399
I will... Yes.

669
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:54,151
You promised me. Remember that.

670
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,319
I will... I promise.

671
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:56,361
There's a reason...

672
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:59,114
a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.

673
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:00,991
I know, Baz.

674
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:02,034
Indy.

675
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:05,329
Thanks, Wombat.

676
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:07,456
He's gonna be all right in a few days.

677
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:10,959
I'll call you as soon as I land.

678
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:17,299
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

679
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:19,927
<i>we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.</i>

680
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,087
-Stop drinking!
-What are you doing?

681
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:56,839
No more champagne! How many more...

682
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:57,881
I'm staying.

683
00:54:58,048 --> 00:54:59,508
Go home. Go home!

684
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:18,527
Miss Shaw, she's here.

685
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:23,615
Forged in bronze.

686
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,075
Nearly complete.

687
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:26,869
It is an astrological clock.

688
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:29,663
Dating third century BC...

689
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,750
and built by Archimedes himself.

690
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,212
All right, let's start at 20,000.

691
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:38,463
20,000, thank you very much.

692
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,965
30. 30.

693
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:41,049
Gauges green...

694
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:42,801
power full...

695
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:45,304
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

696
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:46,763
What next?

697
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,016
-Louis, help him! He's so cute.
-Pull back on the yoke.

698
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,393
-I did, man. I'm airborne.
-Yeah, he's airborne.

699
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,769
-Can I have a sip?
-Do I pick up the flaps?

700
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:54,938
Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.

701
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,773
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.

702
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,941
All right.

703
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,779
-Private auction, old timer.
-I've gotta get in there.

704
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:05,449
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

705
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,037
-And what is the current bid?
-The bid is 50,000.

706
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:11,455
Then I bid 55.

707
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:13,415
-Who'll give me 60?
-60.

708
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,083
60. 65?

709
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,418
-65. 70?
-75.

710
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:17,836
-75. 80?
-80.

711
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,630
-85.
-How about 90?

712
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:27,471
This auction is private.

713
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:28,889
This auction's over.

714
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,599
<i>Au contraire</i>, it's hardly begun.

715
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,184
-100.
-100,000.

716
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,894
I like the hat, by the way.

717
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,312
Makes you look at least two years younger.

718
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,563
Thanks.

719
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,315
-110, bravo.
-I told you that this auction is over.

720
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,775
Excuse me, who is this man?

721
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,318
-I'm her godfather.
-He's mildly related.

722
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,403
And she's up past her bedtime.

723
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,780
-Come on, Wombat.
-I wouldn't do that.

724
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:46,448
You want to explain it to the cops
at the bar?

725
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:47,950
The ones I paid off?

726
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,077
You're out of your depth, Jonesy.

727
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,578
-"Jonesy"?
-He thinks I'm a criminal.

728
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:53,497
He's the one wanted for murder.

729
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,707
Nice big picture in the <i>New York Herald. </i>130?

730
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:57,501
I didn't kill anyone.

731
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,461
-No entry, it's a private auction.
-And you know it, Helena.

732
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:03,507
But whoever did was looking for this.

733
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,051
What you've got here is Pandora's Box.

734
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:08,512
No, actually.

735
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:10,848
It's my box.

736
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:14,476
You.

737
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:17,312
Have we met?

738
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:18,480
No.

739
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:20,023
My memory is a little fuzzy...

740
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,900
but your face rings a bell.

741
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,569
Are you still a Nazi?

742
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:29,825
You're confused. My name is Schmidt.

743
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,578
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.

744
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:35,205
Professor Schmidt.

745
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:36,623
How nice to meet you in person.

746
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,376
-150.
-After our conversation, Miss Shaw...

747
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:41,503
I thought we'd come to an agreement
about the Dial.

748
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,881
Funny. The last time I saw the other guy
who looks like you...

749
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:45,799
he was also after this.

750
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:48,010
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.

751
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:49,261
But good news is, you're here now.

752
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:51,889
-The bid is 160.
-You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.

753
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:53,307
This relic is my property.

754
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:54,975
It's not yours. You stole it.

755
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:55,893
Then you stole it.

756
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:57,644
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

757
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:58,687
The bid is 160.

758
00:57:58,854 --> 00:57:59,730
-160.
-170?

759
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:00,856
You should've stayed in New York.

760
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,900
-170?
-You should've stayed out of Poland.

761
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:04,902
170. Anyone? Anyone?

762
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:06,361
Going, going...

763
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:07,738
Gone!

764
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:09,364
Stay away!

765
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:12,117
Get the Dial.

766
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:17,789
Stay away!

767
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,008
Oh, hello, Claude.

768
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,551
You should not have come back, Helena.

769
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,937
Get back.

770
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:51,657
Teddy!

771
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:07,172
Rahim says you stay.

772
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:19,977
Thank you.

773
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:34,533
See you in the past, Dr. Jones.

774
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,293
Move! Get out of the way!

775
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:02,603
It's my cab!

776
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,318
Tell them to back off.

777
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:10,861
I just told them to shoot you.

778
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:14,156
All right, guys.

779
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:16,909
Put the guns down.

780
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,285
Put 'em down.

781
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:21,246
All right.

782
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:24,249
That's better.

783
01:00:28,086 --> 01:00:29,713
Oh, dear.

784
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:40,891
Rahim.

785
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,477
You're in pajamas.

786
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:45,687
I was sleeping, Helena.

787
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:47,064
Peacefully.

788
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:49,816
Then my father woke me.

789
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,611
He told me you'd returned to our hotel.

790
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:56,365
Then he handed me this scimitar...

791
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:59,368
and told me to come home with your head.

792
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:02,496
Does it have to be that bit?

793
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:13,048
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

794
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,341
Rahim...

795
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,677
I had an item to sell.

796
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,720
Excuse me. The item she's talking about...

797
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,514
-actually belongs to me.
-No. You do not need to...

798
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:21,765
-And some very bad people...
-...intrude in this conversation.

799
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:24,059
-...worse people, have run off with it.
-You do not need to get involved...

800
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:25,143
-with my business.
-Is this your new man?

801
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,603
-No. No, no.
-It's complicated.

802
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:29,857
What exactly do you owe this guy?

803
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:32,109
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

804
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,944
I presume you sold the ring.

805
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:35,445
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

806
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:36,947
I'll do it!

807
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:38,156
What are you... Hey!

808
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:45,956
You just got me killed!

809
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,709
Well, I'm not the one that's engaged
to a mobster!

810
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:51,795
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

811
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:53,172
I'm not a grave robber.

812
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,632
Your father and I
did important work together.

813
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,262
Don't tell me all your escapades were noble,
selfless quests.

814
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:01,305
You did it for the buzz!

815
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,058
Oh, good work, Teddy!

816
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,270
-Move over, kid.
-Hey!

817
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:20,824
-Helena!
-Back up! Back up!

818
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,426
Not this way!

819
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:40,886
You don't know where you're going, Indy!

820
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:42,888
-Listen to him. He knows this town!
-I know Tangier!

821
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:48,435
There he is!

822
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:55,692
Faster. Go faster!

823
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,819
Ten minutes to the airport, boss.

824
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,491
I'm not sure Professor Schmidt
is an actual professor, by the way.

825
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:03,784
-He's a Nazi!
-Turn left!

826
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,494
Turn left! Turn left!

827
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:06,745
-Oh, no!
-No!

828
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:23,387
Helena! Don't do this!

829
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,896
-Hey, this way!
-That way!

830
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:34,690
No!

831
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,317
Helena!

832
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,362
No!

833
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,623
What the hell?

834
01:03:58,255 --> 01:03:59,506
Helena!

835
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:02,301
Hey!

836
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:03,343
Hey!

837
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:04,928
What the hell?

838
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:09,266
Come on!

839
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:14,897
Come on. Come on!

840
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:51,391
You think he'd be proud of this?

841
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,476
Who?

842
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:55,062
Your father!

843
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:58,148
His only daughter selling her soul
for bail money!

844
01:04:58,315 --> 01:04:59,691
Sounds quite cool when you put it like that.

845
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:01,485
And it's not all bail money.

846
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:03,946
-Some of it's gambling debt and some...
-Thank you, Teddy.

847
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:05,822
Helena!
No!

848
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:06,990
Helena!

849
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,577
How did you end up like this?

850
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:12,079
Well, you mean resourceful?

851
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,581
Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?

852
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:40,732
Hold on!

853
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:45,445
Go this way!

854
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:55,831
There he is.

855
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,929
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Hey!

856
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,818
On the left!

857
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:26,945
Take the wheel, Teddy!

858
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:30,199
What are you doing?

859
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:31,909
Getting what's mine.

860
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:33,869
Helena!

861
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,625
Damn it! You crazy?

862
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:44,171
Hey! Helena!

863
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,760
-Take the gun!
-Miss Shaw.

864
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:52,846
Let go, Miss Shaw!

865
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:16,620
Let go.

866
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:19,164
Come on! Give me the Dial!

867
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,959
Helena!

868
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:24,795
Damn.

869
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,679
-Turn back! They went that way!
-He's gone!

870
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:35,681
-Move over!
-Hey!

871
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:42,145
I didn't come here to rescue you
from your fiancé!

872
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:43,146
Rescue me?

873
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:49,945
I just want the Dial back.

874
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:10,883
Put your hands above your head.

875
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:13,594
Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.

876
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,971
-If your father was still alive...
-Well, he's not, Indy.

877
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:17,555
Hey, something's wrong with the engine.

878
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:19,725
If only there'd been someone there for me,
some father figure...

879
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:22,728
someone specifically anointed for the job.

880
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,147
-You have no idea about the kind...
-Don't beat yourself up about it.

881
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:27,399
I mean, what even is a godfather?

882
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,444
Anyway, family never was your strong suit.

883
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,447
-What is the time, by the way?
-It's...

884
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:34,615
Hey, no fair.

885
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:36,283
Give me that back.

886
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,658
That was my father's watch!

887
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:41,078
Give it back to him.

888
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,960
You're gonna have to leave town with me.

889
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:48,629
Rahim will be looking for you too.

890
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:50,005
They'll go to Tangier airport first...

891
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:52,341
so we'll need to catch a train
and get a plane from Casablanca.

892
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,426
What was that?

893
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:01,517
Damn.

894
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,020
Yeah.

895
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:06,063
I know, sir.

896
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:09,316
Yes...

897
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:11,652
Copy.

898
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:17,908
They pulled the plug.

899
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:19,535
You got them scared.

900
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,578
-Because they don't understand.
-No.

901
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:24,163
Because your associates killed
three American civilians...

902
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,582
and blew up a nationally televised parade.

903
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,711
Because you stood up
the President of the United States...

904
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:31,046
ran to Morocco...

905
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:33,590
and created an incident
that required military extraction!

906
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:37,426
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

907
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:38,929
They want you to vanish.

908
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:41,223
We have half the Dial now.

909
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,724
They were just trying to keep you happy...

910
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:45,394
letting you chase that thing.

911
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,770
They never cared about it.

912
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:49,481
They will, Miss Mason,
when they understand what it can do.

913
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:50,774
You put them on the moon.

914
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,734
They got what they wanted.

915
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:55,946
All right, buckle up. We're landing in Spain.

916
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,574
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

917
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,200
I'm not going back to Alabama!

918
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,619
All we need is a vessel to take us
to the Mediterranean.

919
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:04,663
The Grafikos will take us to the other...

920
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,874
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

921
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,083
Let go of me, Schmidt.

922
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,877
I'm asking you personally.

923
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,212
You're a piece of work, Doc.

924
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:14,756
Hey!

925
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:44,286
Schmidt...

926
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:46,830
My name is Voller.

927
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,001
Jürgen Voller.

928
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,058
That's a Sea Stallion.

929
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:07,643
American helicopter.

930
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:10,354
Did you know the Wright Brothers?

931
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,272
-What?
-The Wright Brothers.

932
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:13,524
Orville and Wilbur.

933
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,943
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

934
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:17,653
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

935
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,239
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

936
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:22,950
And the Wright Brothers were born
during the Civil War.

937
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,244
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school
with them.

938
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:29,122
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.

939
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:30,123
"Funny"?

940
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,962
I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

941
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,296
I'm wanted for murder.

942
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,423
Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...

943
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,008
and your father's notebooks.

944
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:42,386
I have a copy.

945
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,638
Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.

946
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:45,681
Where?

947
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,725
You memorized five notebooks?

948
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:50,102
Seven. And of course not.

949
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:51,895
Half of them were as dull as ditchwater.

950
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:55,190
Just the really important bits.

951
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,067
Like what?

952
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:58,652
The location of the Grafikos.

953
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:00,529
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.

954
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:02,030
-Dad did.
-No, he didn't.

955
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:03,365
-Yes, he did.
-No, he didn't.

956
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:05,158
-Yes, he did.
-What's a Grafikos?

957
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:06,618
It's directions to the rest of the Dial.

958
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:08,370
Ask her if she knows what language it's in.

959
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,372
It isn't in a language. It's in a code.

960
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:11,748
What code?

961
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:13,375
Archimedes used two codes.

962
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,085
Linear B and Polybius Square.

963
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:18,630
So, even if you find the Grafikos,
without me, you can't read it.

964
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:20,424
Please.

965
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:22,426
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.

966
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:24,178
Used to leave little notes around the house.

967
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,262
"Tidy your room."

968
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:26,722
"Stay away from my brandy."

969
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:28,891
What if it's Linear B?

970
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,226
50 quid it's Polybius.

971
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:33,395
Give me that.

972
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:34,479
Hey.

973
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:36,106
That won't work.

974
01:12:36,273 --> 01:12:38,525
Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap
of the Manilkara.

975
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:39,985
Heat resistant.

976
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:42,696
Try and start it.

977
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:48,785
-Start it.
-I am.

978
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:52,456
Huh? Huh?

979
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:54,750
-Huh?
-It won't hold.

980
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,835
It'll get us to the train station.

981
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:58,128
"Us"?

982
01:12:58,295 --> 01:12:59,505
-You goin' home?
-No.

983
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,465
I'm going to Casablanca.

984
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:03,425
Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.

985
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:04,468
Just like you.

986
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:06,428
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

987
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:09,681
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

988
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,934
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.

989
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:13,852
Where else would it be?

990
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:15,020
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

991
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,313
And you don't have coordinates.

992
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,023
And you don't have a boat.

993
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:23,362
I've got an old friend in Greece.

994
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:24,905
An expert diver.

995
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:26,907
With a big, beautiful boat...

996
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:29,117
that'll get us there before they will.

997
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:32,037
You need me...

998
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:33,413
and you know it.

999
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:24,798
Renny!

1000
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:27,759
Indy?

1001
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,803
Indy!

1002
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:37,227
So, that's the expert diver?

1003
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:39,605
Spain's greatest frogman.

1004
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:43,400
Hey!

1005
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:47,029
So, Spain's greatest frogman has a shit boat
and only one good frog leg?

1006
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:48,238
Stop it.

1007
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:53,368
You got a different boat.

1008
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:54,369
Stop it.

1009
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,843
We're going here.

1010
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,931
Where they found the first part
of the Antikythera.

1011
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:15,807
But...

1012
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,644
we're going deeper.

1013
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:23,941
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver
who found the Dial.

1014
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:25,275
He told him...

1015
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:28,403
that the wrecked Roman ship broke up
under the sea...

1016
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,696
70 feet below.

1017
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:32,824
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1018
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,160
That's where they found it.

1019
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:39,831
But he said that most of the ship
had broken off...

1020
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,750
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1021
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:44,294
Too deep for sponge divers.

1022
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:48,173
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship...

1023
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:51,718
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1024
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:58,809
They weren't taking half a Dial
for a joyride.

1025
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,231
They had the Grafikos...

1026
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:09,278
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1027
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:14,199
Your dad was a genius.

1028
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:15,742
Yeah.

1029
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:18,245
He was.

1030
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:39,183
Seven of spades.

1031
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:43,562
How do you do that?

1032
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:44,771
Wow.

1033
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:46,440
Do it again.

1034
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:52,321
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1035
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:00,954
Seven of spades!

1036
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:04,124
She's magic.

1037
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,459
Trick deck.

1038
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:06,585
No.

1039
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:09,213
I force the card.

1040
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:10,672
I offer the mark...

1041
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,007
you...

1042
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:13,175
the feeling of a choice...

1043
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:15,552
but ultimately,
I make you pick the card I want.

1044
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:18,847
"The mark."

1045
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:23,810
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1046
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:25,771
I have to check the lines.

1047
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:32,861
Good night.

1048
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:39,117
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1049
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:41,828
Dates?

1050
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:43,288
What dates?

1051
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,207
These dates.

1052
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,380
Written over and over again in this letter.

1053
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,633
August 20th, 1969.

1054
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,343
That's three days from now.

1055
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,762
And the same date in 1939.

1056
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:01,348
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.

1057
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:04,768
Wait.

1058
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,896
Now you believe the Dial has magical powers?

1059
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:11,233
I don't believe in magic, Wombat.

1060
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:15,487
But a few times in my life, I've seen things.

1061
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:20,367
Things I can't explain.

1062
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:24,079
And I've come to believe it's not so much...

1063
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,373
what you believe.

1064
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,792
It's how hard you believe it.

1065
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,255
I've seen things too, Indy.

1066
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:36,717
The only thing worth believing in, ever...

1067
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:38,552
is cash.

1068
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:41,930
Right.

1069
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:48,854
What if you could go back in time?

1070
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,232
What would you do?

1071
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:55,027
Witness the Trojan War?

1072
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,654
Check in on Cleopatra?

1073
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:03,410
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

1074
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,290
Did he sign up to please you?

1075
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:11,585
No, he signed up to piss me off.

1076
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,466
How would you have stopped him?

1077
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:23,472
I'd tell him he was gonna die.

1078
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,397
I'd tell him that his mother would...

1079
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:36,860
find no end to her grief.

1080
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:40,447
And that his father would be...

1081
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:45,202
helpless to console her.

1082
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,999
And that the loss would put an end
to their marriage.

1083
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,223
You're still wearing the ring.

1084
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:30,581
Promising.

1085
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:40,465
More promising.

1086
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:47,347
Hello.

1087
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:51,560
Get your gear on. They're waiting.

1088
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,024
Hey.

1089
01:20:58,275 --> 01:20:59,276
Come here.

1090
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,528
Okay.

1091
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:02,487
I'm gonna show you something.

1092
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,573
Gosh, this looks important.

1093
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:08,702
Around the rope...

1094
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:11,038
Now, we are going deep.

1095
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:14,041
Descend fast,
and breathe through these hoses.

1096
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:15,042
Okay?

1097
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:17,044
Stay separate.

1098
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:19,171
No crisscross. All right?

1099
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:20,506
We cannot stay long.

1100
01:21:20,672 --> 01:21:24,009
I have a method
that usually prevents the bends.

1101
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,053
-Usually?
-Yeah.

1102
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,429
I call it "the bounce."

1103
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:28,597
You know, fast down...

1104
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,682
three minutes on the bottom, and then up.

1105
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:31,892
Three minutes!

1106
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:33,894
No one more second.

1107
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:35,437
Three minutes.

1108
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:36,813
Yeah, that's right.

1109
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,815
-Where is my lighter?
-I don't know, <i>capitán.</i>

1110
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:40,984
We have to go.

1111
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:44,780
Quick question.

1112
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:46,281
What's that?

1113
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:47,741
-They're sharks?
-No.

1114
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:50,285
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1115
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:52,287
Eels?

1116
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:53,664
Anguilas.

1117
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:54,748
Most are small.

1118
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:56,500
Sometimes they are big. Two meters.

1119
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:58,710
But if you see them, stay still.

1120
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:02,089
They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1121
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:03,674
They look like snakes.

1122
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,425
No, they don't.

1123
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:07,636
Private Brandy reporting for duty.

1124
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:09,137
You're not coming, Teddy?

1125
01:22:09,888 --> 01:22:11,014
I can't swim.

1126
01:22:11,181 --> 01:22:12,307
Lucky him.

1127
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:13,767
Everyone can swim.

1128
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:17,604
Reach and pull. Reach and pull.

1129
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:21,900
All right. You stay here with Hector
and watch our lines.

1130
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:26,947
It is time, <i>camarada.</i>

1131
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:16,306
Two minutes?

1132
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:48,607
<i>I got it.</i>

1133
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:30,440
Hey.

1134
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:03,348
<i>Hurry up!</i>

1135
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:19,990
Helena!

1136
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:29,750
Come on.

1137
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,460
That's it. That's it. That's it.

1138
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:33,504
That's it.

1139
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:57,903
Who are these people?

1140
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:01,198
Nazis.

1141
01:28:01,365 --> 01:28:03,825
First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...

1142
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:07,120
and now, you bring me the Grafikos.

1143
01:28:08,038 --> 01:28:10,207
I'm very happy you're not wasting
in retirement.

1144
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:12,960
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1145
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:14,253
Where are your sponsors?

1146
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:16,004
I'm on my own now.

1147
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:17,881
Things move forward, Dr. Jones.

1148
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:18,924
And sometimes...

1149
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:22,594
they go backward.

1150
01:28:25,848 --> 01:28:28,100
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1151
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:56,545
What language is that?

1152
01:28:56,712 --> 01:28:58,297
It's not a language.

1153
01:28:59,548 --> 01:29:00,632
It's a code.

1154
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:02,467
Polybius.

1155
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:04,595
You owe me 50 quid.

1156
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:08,724
Not familiar with Polybius cipher?

1157
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:09,808
No.

1158
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:12,060
But it appears you are.

1159
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,399
Read it, please.

1160
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:26,783
No.

1161
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:33,540
Indy...

1162
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:45,928
Feeling helpful now?

1163
01:29:49,348 --> 01:29:50,182
I am.

1164
01:29:53,352 --> 01:29:54,603
I know this stuff backwards.

1165
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:55,646
No!

1166
01:29:57,523 --> 01:29:58,440
Sorry, Indy.

1167
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:00,234
I don't do noble death.

1168
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:01,985
Just...

1169
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:03,570
cold, hard maths.

1170
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:05,948
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1171
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:09,034
One hundred grand. Cash.

1172
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:10,160
Helena...

1173
01:30:10,827 --> 01:30:11,787
Take it or leave it.

1174
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,373
You have a deal.

1175
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,680
He'll never pay you.

1176
01:30:31,223 --> 01:30:34,101
I think you will find this is worth
more than your asking price.

1177
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:45,112
-Teddy.
-Helena...

1178
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:46,446
don't do this.

1179
01:30:51,869 --> 01:30:53,287
Let's see what we've got here.

1180
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:56,832
"My <i>Makhana...</i>"

1181
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:58,333
that's "machine"...

1182
01:30:59,585 --> 01:31:03,130
"lies with me, in the city I left.

1183
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:05,674
"Where wolves teach men to walk.

1184
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:09,970
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1185
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,516
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.

1186
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:17,394
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,
then...

1187
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:20,772
then this is directions to his tomb.

1188
01:31:21,273 --> 01:31:22,608
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1189
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:25,819
Undiscovered for two millennia.

1190
01:31:28,906 --> 01:31:30,991
"The city I left."

1191
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:35,078
Archimedes lived two places his entire life,
so he only left one.

1192
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:37,956
Anyone? At the back?

1193
01:31:38,832 --> 01:31:40,375
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.

1194
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:41,376
Even this clown.

1195
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:42,878
Alexandria.

1196
01:31:43,045 --> 01:31:44,087
Full marks.

1197
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:47,508
Now, "wolf" in Greek is "<i>lycos</i>."

1198
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:49,927
Root of the word "<i>lycaeum"</i> or "school."

1199
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:52,721
And the Doric for "walking" is...

1200
01:31:54,139 --> 01:31:54,973
<i>"peripatio."</i>

1201
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:59,019
Which also happens to be the word for...

1202
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:06,235
I thought you were a bright spark.

1203
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,949
<i>"Peripatio" </i>means "walking"...

1204
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:14,535
but it also means "counting."

1205
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:17,829
So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...

1206
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,874
-could be...
-The School of Mathematics.

1207
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:23,794
Is correct.

1208
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:25,504
Now, the next bit is easy.

1209
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,382
"Beneath one of nine"?

1210
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,884
There are nine Muses.

1211
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:32,177
The <i>Museon.</i>

1212
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:34,805
The Greek word
for the Great Library of Alexandria.

1213
01:32:34,972 --> 01:32:38,767
Which, as we all know, has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1214
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:39,852
May I?

1215
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:41,937
Thank you.

1216
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:46,149
The nine Muses, in reverse order...

1217
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:49,111
are Calliope...

1218
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:50,863
Urania...

1219
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:53,490
Polymnia...

1220
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:55,993
-Erato...
-Polymnia.

1221
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,579
...and Meli whasisname...

1222
01:32:59,121 --> 01:32:59,955
that other one...

1223
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:01,707
Thalia...

1224
01:33:02,457 --> 01:33:03,667
Euteroe...

1225
01:33:03,834 --> 01:33:05,919
but the first is...

1226
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:07,171
Clio.

1227
01:33:09,006 --> 01:33:10,174
The Muse of history and time.

1228
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:11,550
That Archimedes...

1229
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:12,885
-what a clever bugger.
-The entrance...

1230
01:33:13,051 --> 01:33:15,179
to the tomb
is by the School of Mathematics...

1231
01:33:15,345 --> 01:33:17,055
under a statue of Clio...

1232
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:19,975
in the ruins
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

1233
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:21,435
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1234
01:33:22,978 --> 01:33:23,812
Teddy!

1235
01:33:33,864 --> 01:33:35,324
The Grafikos, get it!

1236
01:34:02,976 --> 01:34:05,687
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1237
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:08,482
When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.

1238
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:11,777
My friend was just murdered.

1239
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:18,283
Sorry.

1240
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:20,202
You told them everything.

1241
01:34:21,912 --> 01:34:22,996
Word for word.

1242
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:25,541
But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.

1243
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:28,252
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1244
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:38,303
Go!

1245
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:42,766
So, what do you see?

1246
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:45,227
Polybius square.

1247
01:34:45,769 --> 01:34:46,895
Made of?

1248
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:50,649
Wax and wood.

1249
01:34:52,276 --> 01:34:53,527
Anything else?

1250
01:34:57,114 --> 01:34:57,990
It's heavy.

1251
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:02,160
Too heavy.

1252
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:05,414
Give me that.

1253
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:47,331
This is solid gold?

1254
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:48,707
Ancient gold.

1255
01:35:50,209 --> 01:35:51,210
From the Nile.

1256
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:53,879
Hold it, Teddy.

1257
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,475
Sell this thing...

1258
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:08,310
and we are out of the hole and then some.

1259
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:09,394
I have just the customer.

1260
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:12,564
-Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...
-This is going in a museum.

1261
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:17,152
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1262
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:25,035
What does it say?

1263
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:30,040
"Search where Dionysius...

1264
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:33,585
"hears each whisper...

1265
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:36,463
"like a hurricane."

1266
01:36:39,299 --> 01:36:40,717
The Ear.

1267
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:43,220
The cave of Dionysius.

1268
01:36:44,096 --> 01:36:45,055
Where is that?

1269
01:36:46,515 --> 01:36:47,558
In Sicily.

1270
01:36:49,059 --> 01:36:51,144
-How much fuel have we got?
-It's full.

1271
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:01,154
They're heading west.

1272
01:37:02,531 --> 01:37:03,448
Not east.

1273
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:33,395
I want the papaya.

1274
01:37:33,562 --> 01:37:34,605
How much is it?

1275
01:37:38,066 --> 01:37:38,942
Take this.

1276
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,989
Look at that kid with the straw hat.

1277
01:37:45,157 --> 01:37:46,074
This way.

1278
01:37:49,244 --> 01:37:50,078
Hey.

1279
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:52,915
What do you think?

1280
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:01,215
What are we doing?

1281
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:04,510
Waiting for closing time at the caves.

1282
01:38:04,676 --> 01:38:06,178
It's crawling with tourists.

1283
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:08,764
Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?

1284
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:11,558
He's not running the show, Teddy.

1285
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:16,063
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1286
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:17,814
We are.

1287
01:38:21,318 --> 01:38:22,194
Most assuredly.

1288
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:25,155
You know he's never gonna let us sell
any of that stuff.

1289
01:38:26,657 --> 01:38:28,325
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1290
01:38:28,492 --> 01:38:30,494
Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!

1291
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,543
You splurged.

1292
01:38:38,877 --> 01:38:39,837
Here's your backpack.

1293
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:40,963
Where's the kid?

1294
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:56,019
Hey, watch it!

1295
01:38:56,645 --> 01:38:57,896
What's wrong with you?

1296
01:39:26,425 --> 01:39:27,593
Hello.

1297
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:30,012
Hey.

1298
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,016
Let me go!

1299
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:36,351
Let me go!

1300
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:46,361
Get off me! Let me go!

1301
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:50,908
Hey, hey, hey!

1302
01:40:02,085 --> 01:40:03,170
Helena!

1303
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:06,006
They've got Teddy.

1304
01:40:08,091 --> 01:40:09,676
They took him up the hill somewhere.

1305
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,864
What are they gonna do to him?

1306
01:40:31,031 --> 01:40:33,700
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1307
01:40:35,077 --> 01:40:36,537
They're not gonna hurt him.

1308
01:40:36,703 --> 01:40:37,871
They're gonna use him...

1309
01:40:38,622 --> 01:40:40,874
to get the other half of the Dial.

1310
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:42,417
We gotta get there first.

1311
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:59,226
Colonizing queens built many cities
in Sicily.

1312
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:00,894
-The temple...
-Let's go.

1313
01:41:01,562 --> 01:41:04,106
...is the oldest of the Greek temples.

1314
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:06,567
The cave's over there.

1315
01:41:16,952 --> 01:41:18,704
Could we go a little faster, please?

1316
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:29,381
The Ear of Dionysius.

1317
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:38,056
Wow.

1318
01:41:52,321 --> 01:41:55,824
"Search where Dionysius hears each whisper
like a hurricane."

1319
01:41:57,034 --> 01:41:58,035
That's some echo.

1320
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:02,372
Keep making noise till we find out
where it's loudest.

1321
01:42:19,806 --> 01:42:20,641
Stop.

1322
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:29,691
This is it.

1323
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:35,656
Greek pediment.

1324
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:37,824
An entrance.

1325
01:42:39,243 --> 01:42:40,244
Used to be.

1326
01:42:43,539 --> 01:42:44,540
A crescent.

1327
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:48,502
Just like on the Grafikos.

1328
01:42:56,093 --> 01:42:57,928
I think there's an opening up there.

1329
01:43:04,685 --> 01:43:05,561
You okay up there?

1330
01:43:06,728 --> 01:43:07,563
Yes.

1331
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:11,441
You're not moving.

1332
01:43:13,944 --> 01:43:15,153
I'm thinking.

1333
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:18,991
About?

1334
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:23,078
About what the hell I'm doing up here,
40 feet in the air...

1335
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:24,997
with crap shoulders...

1336
01:43:25,163 --> 01:43:26,957
crumbling vertebrae...

1337
01:43:27,124 --> 01:43:29,626
a plate in one leg, screws in the other.

1338
01:43:29,793 --> 01:43:31,044
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1339
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:32,796
No, you don't get it.

1340
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:34,840
You're half my age.

1341
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:38,552
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1342
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:39,970
No. Fair enough.

1343
01:43:40,804 --> 01:43:42,556
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1344
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:46,685
And I'm just guessing, but I don't think
you've been shot nine times...

1345
01:43:46,852 --> 01:43:49,313
including once by your father.

1346
01:43:51,064 --> 01:43:52,399
Dad shot you?

1347
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:54,276
Don't talk to me.

1348
01:43:54,443 --> 01:43:55,611
Just go ahead. I'll follow you.

1349
01:44:04,369 --> 01:44:05,245
No, no, no.

1350
01:44:05,412 --> 01:44:06,955
We are close. We are close.

1351
01:44:07,122 --> 01:44:08,123
Look around you.

1352
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:09,791
-We are close.
-The Cave of Dionysius.

1353
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:10,751
No, no, no.

1354
01:44:10,918 --> 01:44:12,836
The cave is closed for renovation.

1355
01:44:14,922 --> 01:44:15,881
Let me ask again.

1356
01:44:16,048 --> 01:44:17,966
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

1357
01:44:37,611 --> 01:44:39,780
What's the matter? You worried about the kid?

1358
01:44:41,073 --> 01:44:42,741
Are you sure they won't hurt him?

1359
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:44,117
He'll be fine.

1360
01:44:44,284 --> 01:44:45,327
He's smart.

1361
01:44:47,204 --> 01:44:48,580
Where'd you find him?

1362
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:54,962
He tried to steal my purse outside a casino
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1363
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:56,964
I hit him repeatedly with my car door...

1364
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:59,633
but he didn't let go and neither did I.

1365
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,343
So, been together ever since.

1366
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:04,429
Thought you were all about the money.

1367
01:45:05,556 --> 01:45:06,557
I am.

1368
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:13,689
Nobody memorizes every page
of their dead father's notebooks...

1369
01:45:13,856 --> 01:45:14,940
for the money.

1370
01:45:21,572 --> 01:45:22,573
<i>Herr</i> Voller!

1371
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,585
They went that way.

1372
01:45:44,928 --> 01:45:45,971
Why?

1373
01:45:49,892 --> 01:45:51,727
Come on, come on.

1374
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:55,397
Let's go.

1375
01:46:00,235 --> 01:46:01,153
Oh, my...

1376
01:46:04,156 --> 01:46:05,657
Oh, my God!

1377
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:07,826
Oh, my God!

1378
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:09,411
-Oh, God!
-No, no.

1379
01:46:10,329 --> 01:46:11,705
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1380
01:46:16,251 --> 01:46:17,294
Are they off me?

1381
01:46:17,461 --> 01:46:18,295
-Get 'em off!
-No, no.

1382
01:46:18,462 --> 01:46:19,630
-Get 'em off!
-Wait.

1383
01:46:32,684 --> 01:46:33,644
What is that?

1384
01:46:36,730 --> 01:46:37,773
Methane.

1385
01:46:39,274 --> 01:46:40,484
Don't breathe.

1386
01:46:40,651 --> 01:46:41,652
Don't breathe?

1387
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:46,740
We've gotta get outta here.

1388
01:46:55,666 --> 01:46:56,583
Athena.

1389
01:46:58,335 --> 01:46:59,628
Goddess of war.

1390
01:47:02,506 --> 01:47:03,715
And reason.

1391
01:47:08,011 --> 01:47:09,388
"Under the moon...

1392
01:47:11,682 --> 01:47:13,684
"life lies at her feet."

1393
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:22,776
Water displacement.

1394
01:47:23,569 --> 01:47:24,903
Get in the pool!

1395
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:27,072
Why? Help me open the door.

1396
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:28,907
Well, they didn't get out the doors!

1397
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:29,950
Get in the pool!

1398
01:47:30,993 --> 01:47:32,870
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1399
01:47:33,036 --> 01:47:34,162
Help me.

1400
01:47:36,874 --> 01:47:38,917
Archimedes was fascinated...

1401
01:47:40,419 --> 01:47:42,379
by water displacement!

1402
01:48:23,587 --> 01:48:24,755
Hey! Get back here!

1403
01:48:24,922 --> 01:48:25,672
Klaber!

1404
01:48:39,895 --> 01:48:41,063
You don't need to do that.

1405
01:49:07,256 --> 01:49:08,090
Hey!

1406
01:49:09,299 --> 01:49:10,133
Give me that!

1407
01:49:12,094 --> 01:49:12,928
No!

1408
01:49:20,352 --> 01:49:21,645
Leave them.

1409
01:49:22,354 --> 01:49:23,981
I said leave them.

1410
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:49,965
Reach and pull.

1411
01:49:50,132 --> 01:49:51,717
Reach and pull.

1412
01:49:51,884 --> 01:49:54,052
Reach and pull.

1413
01:50:22,497 --> 01:50:24,041
Archimedes' tomb.

1414
01:50:52,986 --> 01:50:54,279
Grab that corner.

1415
01:51:40,617 --> 01:51:41,535
Indy.

1416
01:51:43,912 --> 01:51:45,289
This frieze...

1417
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:49,209
It's a phoenix.

1418
01:51:49,376 --> 01:51:50,377
A common icon.

1419
01:51:50,544 --> 01:51:52,129
No. Look, it isn't.

1420
01:51:53,714 --> 01:51:55,424
This phoenix has propellers.

1421
01:52:04,308 --> 01:52:05,767
What's this doing here?

1422
01:52:14,568 --> 01:52:17,571
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years...

1423
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:19,698
much less watches.

1424
01:52:22,242 --> 01:52:23,452
Archimedes used it.

1425
01:52:26,997 --> 01:52:28,373
Dad was right.

1426
01:52:29,124 --> 01:52:29,958
It works.

1427
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:31,752
Of course it works, Miss Shaw.

1428
01:52:34,463 --> 01:52:35,714
Mathematics works.

1429
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,843
As it conquered space, it will conquer time.

1430
01:52:47,726 --> 01:52:49,645
You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1431
01:52:49,811 --> 01:52:50,729
Your wife is gone.

1432
01:52:50,896 --> 01:52:52,814
Do you really want to lose your godchild?

1433
01:52:55,901 --> 01:52:56,985
For what?

1434
01:52:57,402 --> 01:52:59,571
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1435
01:53:11,083 --> 01:53:11,917
Thank you.

1436
01:53:50,622 --> 01:53:51,999
History's greatest moment.

1437
01:53:59,089 --> 01:54:00,382
Its end.

1438
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,057
Throw me the gun!

1439
01:54:19,443 --> 01:54:20,694
Get him outta here.

1440
01:54:20,861 --> 01:54:21,695
Teddy.

1441
01:54:22,738 --> 01:54:23,864
Teddy! Teddy!

1442
01:54:24,031 --> 01:54:25,115
Come on! Go!

1443
01:54:25,282 --> 01:54:26,158
This way. Come on.

1444
01:54:30,245 --> 01:54:31,079
Go!

1445
01:54:35,542 --> 01:54:36,376
Indy!

1446
01:54:38,378 --> 01:54:39,546
Go!

1447
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:40,964
Go!

1448
01:54:41,131 --> 01:54:42,216
Stop!

1449
01:54:45,594 --> 01:54:47,012
Now what?

1450
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:49,640
Bring him.

1451
01:54:57,731 --> 01:54:58,732
Helena, come on!

1452
01:54:58,899 --> 01:55:00,234
-Teddy, we can't just leave him.
-We're not!

1453
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,610
Follow me!

1454
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:04,571
Come on!

1455
01:55:08,492 --> 01:55:09,326
Come on.

1456
01:55:23,757 --> 01:55:25,717
Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.

1457
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:31,598
Crap.

1458
01:55:37,813 --> 01:55:38,856
Stay there.

1459
01:55:57,749 --> 01:55:58,750
Hop on.

1460
01:56:02,379 --> 01:56:05,299
The first hemisphere sets the destination.

1461
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,387
The second calculates the location
of the fissure...

1462
01:56:11,638 --> 01:56:13,473
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1463
01:56:14,057 --> 01:56:16,935
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude...

1464
01:56:17,978 --> 01:56:19,855
and transmit waypoints to the pilots.

1465
01:56:31,992 --> 01:56:33,493
Shortcut.

1466
01:56:37,789 --> 01:56:42,169
-You got coordinates for 37.07.
-So, who is it?

1467
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,171
Churchill?

1468
01:56:45,506 --> 01:56:46,507
Ike?

1469
01:56:48,842 --> 01:56:51,345
Who are you gonna kill to win the war?

1470
01:56:52,179 --> 01:56:55,057
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes...

1471
01:56:55,224 --> 01:56:57,100
we shall fly into the eye of this storm...

1472
01:56:57,893 --> 01:57:00,145
and cross into Sicilian airspace...

1473
01:57:00,312 --> 01:57:03,815
on August 20th, 1939.

1474
01:57:04,566 --> 01:57:08,111
We will head north over friendly skies
with enough fuel to reach Munich.

1475
01:57:09,404 --> 01:57:11,031
My quarry will be waiting for me...

1476
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:14,034
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...

1477
01:57:14,409 --> 01:57:16,620
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

1478
01:57:23,627 --> 01:57:27,589
What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?

1479
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,885
The kind that believes in victory, Dr. Jones.

1480
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:40,978
Hitler lit a fire that could have burned
1,000 years.

1481
01:57:41,144 --> 01:57:42,646
I saw every mistake.

1482
01:57:43,438 --> 01:57:44,731
Every blunder.

1483
01:57:44,898 --> 01:57:46,567
And I will correct them all.

1484
01:57:46,733 --> 01:57:49,361
History is a long list of losses, Dr. Jones.

1485
01:57:50,404 --> 01:57:51,655
It's just a question of whose.

1486
01:58:04,334 --> 01:58:05,335
Stop!

1487
01:59:18,492 --> 01:59:19,326
Teddy.

1488
01:59:21,161 --> 01:59:22,162
You think you can fly one of those?

1489
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:25,165
A Nord?

1490
01:59:27,918 --> 01:59:28,877
Sure.

1491
01:59:29,628 --> 01:59:30,754
It's not a ringing response.

1492
01:59:30,921 --> 01:59:32,548
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1493
01:59:32,714 --> 01:59:34,258
You've never flown any plane.

1494
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:37,261
I'll get it started.

1495
01:59:37,427 --> 01:59:38,679
No, Teddy.

1496
01:59:40,055 --> 01:59:40,889
Crap.

1497
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:09,835
Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1498
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:11,336
There might be some turbulence.

1499
02:00:12,296 --> 02:00:14,756
You're German, Voller.

1500
02:00:14,923 --> 02:00:16,925
Don't try and be funny.

1501
02:00:40,324 --> 02:00:42,159
Come on, big talker.

1502
02:00:57,132 --> 02:00:57,966
Okay.

1503
02:01:14,816 --> 02:01:16,401
Okay. Okay.

1504
02:01:16,568 --> 02:01:19,112
Gauges green. Power full.

1505
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:22,282
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1506
02:02:00,028 --> 02:02:01,446
Okay, wings down.

1507
02:02:03,532 --> 02:02:05,534
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1508
02:02:05,993 --> 02:02:06,952
Rotate.

1509
02:03:14,853 --> 02:03:16,188
Time to destination?

1510
02:03:17,397 --> 02:03:18,941
60 seconds.

1511
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:25,739
Continental drift.

1512
02:03:29,159 --> 02:03:30,369
Continental drift!

1513
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:34,706
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1514
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:36,792
He couldn't have!

1515
02:03:37,793 --> 02:03:39,711
It hadn't been observed yet.

1516
02:03:40,712 --> 02:03:42,506
You're off target.

1517
02:03:42,965 --> 02:03:44,842
Your coordinates are based on markers...

1518
02:03:45,592 --> 02:03:48,804
that have been moving for 2000 years!

1519
02:03:48,971 --> 02:03:52,391
You could be off by 10 degrees, by...

1520
02:04:07,364 --> 02:04:08,949
30 seconds.

1521
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,034
<i>Herr </i>Voller<i>...</i>

1522
02:04:11,201 --> 02:04:13,912
Your calculations are wrong!

1523
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:15,664
-<i>Herr </i>Voller...
<i>-</i>Will you shut up?

1524
02:04:16,331 --> 02:04:17,332
I'm thinking!

1525
02:04:20,294 --> 02:04:21,211
20 seconds.

1526
02:04:24,006 --> 02:04:25,090
Hold the flight path!

1527
02:04:27,092 --> 02:04:28,385
15 seconds.

1528
02:04:31,930 --> 02:04:33,390
I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.

1529
02:04:33,557 --> 02:04:34,391
10 seconds.

1530
02:04:35,309 --> 02:04:35,934
9!

1531
02:04:36,101 --> 02:04:36,935
But it sure as hell...

1532
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:37,561
8!

1533
02:04:38,187 --> 02:04:38,812
7!

1534
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:39,646
...ain't 1939!

1535
02:04:39,813 --> 02:04:40,439
6!

1536
02:04:40,606 --> 02:04:41,857
Turn around!

1537
02:04:42,566 --> 02:04:43,442
Abort!

1538
02:04:43,942 --> 02:04:44,693
Turn around!

1539
02:04:45,652 --> 02:04:46,320
ABORT!!!

1540
02:04:46,778 --> 02:04:48,739
We're being pulled in!

1541
02:04:58,749 --> 02:05:00,083
What are you doing?!

1542
02:05:00,292 --> 02:05:01,126
This is my plane!

1543
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,794
You're flying my plane!

1544
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:28,779
We're going to DIE!!!

1545
02:05:30,113 --> 02:05:31,823
We need to pull up!

1546
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:54,847
Restart engines!

1547
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:24,626
That's Sicily.

1548
02:06:24,793 --> 02:06:26,003
1939.

1549
02:06:27,754 --> 02:06:29,173
I did it.

1550
02:06:29,339 --> 02:06:30,841
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1551
02:06:31,008 --> 02:06:32,718
Setting coordinates for Munich.

1552
02:06:39,683 --> 02:06:41,727
Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1553
02:07:06,627 --> 02:07:08,795
Those are Roman triremes.

1554
02:07:37,032 --> 02:07:38,242
Keep it in the air!

1555
02:07:58,512 --> 02:07:59,096
Master...

1556
02:07:59,346 --> 02:08:01,765
The Romans are getting closer.

1557
02:08:03,517 --> 02:08:04,393
They have dragons!

1558
02:08:09,106 --> 02:08:10,482
Amazing.

1559
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:20,909
Open the door!

1560
02:08:25,873 --> 02:08:26,874
What are you doing?

1561
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:29,543
What are you doing, you idiots?

1562
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:31,503
They think we're a monster!

1563
02:08:37,968 --> 02:08:39,469
You have to turn around.

1564
02:08:39,636 --> 02:08:41,555
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1565
02:08:42,681 --> 02:08:44,016
214 BC.

1566
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:45,392
You got the wrong war.

1567
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:49,855
Master...

1568
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,651
Don't ride out there, Master!

1569
02:08:55,235 --> 02:08:56,445
The dragons!!

1570
02:09:06,705 --> 02:09:10,209
We must take down their dragons!

1571
02:09:17,382 --> 02:09:18,217
Boss!

1572
02:09:18,383 --> 02:09:19,218
Change course!

1573
02:09:19,468 --> 02:09:20,844
The portal closes in minutes!

1574
02:09:21,261 --> 02:09:22,179
I have to go back!

1575
02:09:22,638 --> 02:09:23,764
I can't be here!

1576
02:09:23,972 --> 02:09:25,057
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

1577
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:26,683
The plane won't make it!!

1578
02:09:56,463 --> 02:09:57,381
Get out of the way!

1579
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:05,848
How do you like that, you savages?

1580
02:10:08,892 --> 02:10:11,645
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1581
02:10:21,697 --> 02:10:23,782
What are you doing here?

1582
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:25,492
Rescuing you!

1583
02:10:37,045 --> 02:10:37,921
Get him off!

1584
02:10:39,298 --> 02:10:40,382
Indy!

1585
02:10:46,013 --> 02:10:47,222
Parachute!

1586
02:10:50,017 --> 02:10:51,185
I got a parachute!

1587
02:10:52,686 --> 02:10:53,520
Hang on!

1588
02:10:57,316 --> 02:10:58,192
Let go!

1589
02:11:00,527 --> 02:11:01,945
Give me the parachute!

1590
02:11:07,993 --> 02:11:10,120
Grab it. Hang on!

1591
02:11:12,581 --> 02:11:13,415
Indy!

1592
02:11:40,776 --> 02:11:42,236
We're losing altitude!

1593
02:11:43,487 --> 02:11:44,404
We're going down!

1594
02:11:46,323 --> 02:11:47,908
I've lost control!

1595
02:12:06,134 --> 02:12:08,595
Hey, those are my friends.

1596
02:12:08,762 --> 02:12:10,806
Those are my friends. We need to help them!

1597
02:12:11,974 --> 02:12:13,559
Those are my friends!

1598
02:13:15,454 --> 02:13:16,830
Eureka.

1599
02:13:34,014 --> 02:13:34,890
He's trying to land.

1600
02:13:35,057 --> 02:13:37,059
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1601
02:13:37,809 --> 02:13:39,853
Get up. Yeah.

1602
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:42,314
We need to get you out of here. Okay.

1603
02:13:44,233 --> 02:13:45,526
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1604
02:13:46,401 --> 02:13:47,653
Sit up. You need to help me.

1605
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:49,696
I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.

1606
02:13:49,863 --> 02:13:52,574
This is incredible, Wombat.

1607
02:13:53,116 --> 02:13:55,077
Incredible.

1608
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:58,330
Yeah, it very well is.

1609
02:13:58,497 --> 02:14:00,082
But we have to get you out of here.

1610
02:14:02,209 --> 02:14:03,335
My God.

1611
02:14:05,003 --> 02:14:06,880
We're witnessing history.

1612
02:14:13,971 --> 02:14:15,764
Reverse these numbers.

1613
02:14:15,931 --> 02:14:17,015
They'll get you home.

1614
02:14:18,851 --> 02:14:19,685
What?

1615
02:14:22,604 --> 02:14:23,814
I'm going to stay.

1616
02:14:24,565 --> 02:14:26,567
No. You're not serious.

1617
02:14:29,403 --> 02:14:30,445
Wow, you are serious.

1618
02:14:34,533 --> 02:14:36,243
Indy, you've been shot.

1619
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:37,244
You're bleeding.

1620
02:14:37,619 --> 02:14:39,204
You can't stay here.

1621
02:14:39,371 --> 02:14:40,247
Yes, I can.

1622
02:14:40,914 --> 02:14:41,874
But for what?

1623
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:45,586
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1624
02:14:46,628 --> 02:14:48,755
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1625
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,675
Studied it.

1626
02:14:51,842 --> 02:14:53,886
-All my life.
-Yeah.

1627
02:14:54,052 --> 02:14:57,139
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1628
02:14:57,306 --> 02:14:58,140
And die.

1629
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:00,517
Please, get up.

1630
02:15:02,269 --> 02:15:03,437
Helena!

1631
02:15:03,979 --> 02:15:04,771
I did it!

1632
02:15:04,938 --> 02:15:07,274
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1633
02:15:07,441 --> 02:15:08,984
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.

1634
02:15:09,151 --> 02:15:10,611
-I need to get you into that plane, okay?
-No.

1635
02:15:10,777 --> 02:15:11,695
-We need to.
-No.

1636
02:15:11,862 --> 02:15:13,488
Get up. You can... We can!

1637
02:15:26,668 --> 02:15:27,294
Master!

1638
02:15:30,172 --> 02:15:31,965
We have to leave, Master.

1639
02:15:33,592 --> 02:15:34,593
It's him.

1640
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,604
He's asking how far we've come.

1641
02:15:49,024 --> 02:15:51,777
Two thousand years.

1642
02:15:52,402 --> 02:15:53,570
We've come...

1643
02:15:54,154 --> 02:15:57,157
two thousand years.

1644
02:15:59,493 --> 02:16:02,621
But we didn't expect to meet...

1645
02:16:03,163 --> 02:16:05,666
the great...

1646
02:16:06,208 --> 02:16:08,252
Archimedes.

1647
02:16:13,924 --> 02:16:14,842
You...

1648
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:17,386
were always...

1649
02:16:18,053 --> 02:16:19,304
going to...

1650
02:16:19,888 --> 02:16:21,473
meet me.

1651
02:16:22,224 --> 02:16:24,017
That dial is a forced deck.

1652
02:16:24,184 --> 02:16:25,602
It doesn't take us anywhere but here.

1653
02:16:25,769 --> 02:16:27,062
He built it to get help.

1654
02:16:27,229 --> 02:16:29,773
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy...

1655
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:30,858
so I think we've helped enough.

1656
02:16:31,066 --> 02:16:32,692
Apologies, Archimedes.

1657
02:16:32,901 --> 02:16:34,236
I'm a fan...

1658
02:16:34,486 --> 02:16:36,487
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

1659
02:16:36,655 --> 02:16:37,531
Helena...

1660
02:16:37,698 --> 02:16:38,740
He can't keep that, by the way.

1661
02:16:38,906 --> 02:16:39,782
He needs to build his own one.

1662
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:41,660
Helena, we need to go!

1663
02:16:42,119 --> 02:16:44,245
Indy, the window is closing!

1664
02:16:44,413 --> 02:16:45,539
We cannot get stuck here!

1665
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:47,665
I want...

1666
02:16:47,875 --> 02:16:48,959
to stay...

1667
02:16:49,334 --> 02:16:51,085
with you.

1668
02:16:51,253 --> 02:16:53,213
No, no, no! Do not say yes!

1669
02:16:53,797 --> 02:16:56,049
You are a brilliant man...

1670
02:16:56,299 --> 02:16:58,302
a wise man...

1671
02:16:58,843 --> 02:17:00,179
a genius...

1672
02:17:00,344 --> 02:17:01,180
Helena...

1673
02:17:01,346 --> 02:17:03,682
a hero to your people.

1674
02:17:04,391 --> 02:17:07,936
But he can't help you.

1675
02:17:09,021 --> 02:17:10,731
This is your time.

1676
02:17:10,897 --> 02:17:11,607
This is your time.

1677
02:17:11,772 --> 02:17:13,734
He must be in his own time -

1678
02:17:13,901 --> 02:17:14,985
He needs to be in his.

1679
02:17:15,152 --> 02:17:16,111
His work is not done.

1680
02:17:16,486 --> 02:17:17,446
He needs to go home.

1681
02:17:17,612 --> 02:17:19,198
There is medicine at home.

1682
02:17:19,364 --> 02:17:21,157
He cannot die here. He can't.

1683
02:17:22,825 --> 02:17:25,662
Helena, get on the plane.

1684
02:17:28,248 --> 02:17:29,333
I'll be all right.

1685
02:17:31,168 --> 02:17:32,544
No, you won't.

1686
02:17:35,464 --> 02:17:37,216
I need to do this.

1687
02:17:38,467 --> 02:17:39,300
Me too.

1688
02:18:33,939 --> 02:18:34,815
Good morning.

1689
02:18:39,695 --> 02:18:41,071
How's the shoulder?

1690
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:46,243
Better than my jaw.

1691
02:18:49,871 --> 02:18:50,873
Right.

1692
02:18:52,875 --> 02:18:54,376
You should've let me stay.

1693
02:18:55,252 --> 02:18:56,460
I couldn't do that.

1694
02:19:05,469 --> 02:19:06,388
Why not?

1695
02:19:08,348 --> 02:19:10,893
Well, for starters, you'd have changed
the course of history.

1696
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:17,023
That's supposed to be a bad thing?

1697
02:19:21,153 --> 02:19:22,946
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1698
02:19:26,825 --> 02:19:27,659
Here.

1699
02:19:32,873 --> 02:19:33,999
For who?

1700
02:20:01,318 --> 02:20:02,903
Marion.

1701
02:20:04,154 --> 02:20:05,197
Hey.

1702
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:25,467
Teddy.

1703
02:20:27,094 --> 02:20:28,053
Marion.

1704
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,807
What are you doing?

1705
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:34,518
Putting groceries away.

1706
02:20:36,812 --> 02:20:39,523
There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.

1707
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:42,442
No. Really.

1708
02:20:47,239 --> 02:20:49,449
Someone told me you were back.

1709
02:20:56,915 --> 02:20:58,542
Are you back, Indy?

1710
02:21:00,169 --> 02:21:01,879
It was explosives...

1711
02:21:02,045 --> 02:21:04,173
and Indy was running,
Marion was running...

1712
02:21:04,339 --> 02:21:07,009
and suddenly the plane exploded.

1713
02:21:10,721 --> 02:21:12,764
Indy, you're up and about.

1714
02:21:13,974 --> 02:21:15,350
Yes, I am.

1715
02:21:16,643 --> 02:21:17,477
Yes.

1716
02:21:18,103 --> 02:21:20,147
Why don't we go and get some ice cream, kids?

1717
02:21:20,314 --> 02:21:21,565
But Marion just bought some.

1718
02:21:21,732 --> 02:21:22,816
Oh, I know a better place.

1719
02:21:22,983 --> 02:21:25,194
You can never have too much ice cream,
can you?

1720
02:21:29,072 --> 02:21:29,907
See you later.

1721
02:21:33,118 --> 02:21:36,413
<i>A British tar is a soaring soul</i>

1722
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:39,416
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

1723
02:21:39,583 --> 02:21:41,418
<i>His energetic fist</i>

1724
02:21:41,585 --> 02:21:44,004
<i>Should be ready to resist...</i>

1725
02:21:45,881 --> 02:21:47,174
That looks bad.

1726
02:21:48,675 --> 02:21:49,927
Does it hurt?

1727
02:21:52,471 --> 02:21:53,931
Everything hurts.

1728
02:21:56,808 --> 02:21:58,435
I know how that feels.

1729
02:22:04,525 --> 02:22:07,194
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1730
02:22:15,327 --> 02:22:16,161
Here.

1731
02:22:17,538 --> 02:22:18,789
It doesn't hurt here.

1732
02:22:27,047 --> 02:22:28,590
And here.

1733
02:22:52,197 --> 02:22:54,575
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

1734
02:22:54,741 --> 02:22:56,869
Helena! Hurry up!

1735
02:22:57,035 --> 02:22:59,705
<i>I scream, you scream...</i>

1736
02:22:59,872 --> 02:23:01,623
Everybody, slow down.

1737
02:23:01,707 --> 02:23:04,168
<i>-I scream, you scream
-I scream, I scream</i>

1738
02:23:04,334 --> 02:23:06,044
<i>We all scream for ice cream!</i>

1739
02:23:06,211 --> 02:23:07,379
Slow down.
