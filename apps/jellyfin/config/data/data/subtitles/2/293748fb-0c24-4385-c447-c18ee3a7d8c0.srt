447
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,097
         I followed you
      because I adore you.

448
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,933
      Lisa, I used to know
        what it was like

449
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,027
        to hurt a person
         for no reason.

450
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,920
       Don't do it to me.

451
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,605
  I couldn't be more serious.

452
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:02,200
          <i> I love you</i>
<i> because you're the last person</i>

453
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,426
 <i> I want to talk to at night.</i>

454
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:06,687
<i>When you say "Smell you later,"</i>

455
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,264
<i> I do want to smell you later.</i>

456
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,449
      <i> Wherever I've gone</i>
          <i> in my life,</i>

457
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:13,285
    <i> I'm drawn back to you</i>
<i>like a dork's face to a swirly.</i>

458
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,771
<i> And when I get all wrapped up</i>
       <i> in my feelings,</i>

459
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:19,275
 <i> you're the one who tells me</i>
     <i> feelings are dumb.</i>

460
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:21,277
       But they are dumb,
  if you throw away everything

461
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,796
 for a loser in a clip-on tie.

462
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,798
   I'll tell you what I want,
             mister.

463
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,642
          Haw... Huh?

464
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,877
         (bell tolling)

465
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:34,232
        I lost the girl,
       but I got the bell.

470
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,897
So, I was doing a panel at CPAC,

471
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,808
       the Clone Political
        Action Committee.

472
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,993
 Not the other one, they suck.

473
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:56,254
            And I saw
   the tallest drink of water

474
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,980
   I'd ever seen in my life.

475
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:59,164
           (chuckles)

476
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,833
   I looked at him and said,
        "There's a man

477
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,318
 I'd like to share a bed with."

478
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,170
        That was a thing
       in my day. It was!

479
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:07,265
        Then I found out
         he was an actor

480
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,325
          and, uh, boy,
      that was a red flag.

481
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:12,085
       Well, yes, but now
    we've been running mates

482
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,771
    for four straight terms.

483
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,164
        Didn't hurt that
         we were running

484
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,666
     against Jimmy Carter
     and Grover Cleveland.

485
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,502
           (laughter)

486
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,927
       Oh, we'll be back.

487
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,764
       Between my malaise
and his mugwumps, we can't lose.

488
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,491
           (laughter)

489
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:29,453
              Shh!
