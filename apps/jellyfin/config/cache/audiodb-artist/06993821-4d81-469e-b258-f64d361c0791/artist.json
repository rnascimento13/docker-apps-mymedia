Formed in the early 1990s they have produced hedonism-themed party music with a hardcore hip hop edge, powered by the beats of DJ and producer E-Swift (born Eric Brooks in Columbus, Georgia, raised in Toledo, Ohio) and the rhymes of J-Ro (born James Robinson in Los Angeles) and Tash (born Rico Smith in Cincinnati). Though commercial crossover success largely eluded the group, they maintained a dedicated following on their native West Coast, throughout the United States and worldwide.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"Male","intMembers":"3","strCountry":"Los Angeles, USA","strCountryCode":"US","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/yqsuqp1417197860.jpg","strArtistLogo":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/logo/xstwqp1417270677.png","strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/alkaholiks-tha-5127c68b0902c.jpg","strArtistFanart2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/svpqxs1553239045.jpg","strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/banner/alkaholiks-tha-55d96fa42aa35.jpg","strMusicBrainzID":"06993821-4d81-469e-b258-f64d361c0791","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"3","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
